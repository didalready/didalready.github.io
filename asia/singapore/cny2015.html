      <h2>CHINESE NEW YEAR - SHEEP</h2>
      <h4>2016-02-05, 12:22, JASON</h4>
      <p>‍</p>
      <p>Rolling right along to the next ETHNIC holiday, we have Chinese New Year! Thorin just flew in today, and so we get to spend our new years together, especially after he went to&nbsp;Hawaii&nbsp;for Solar new year. Now, it's lunar time.</p>
      <p>I always grew up with celebrating Chinese New Year passively. My parents are from Taiwan and so we had the usual celebrations at home, which involved a dinner and family get-togethers. However, actually being physically present in an Asian country brought this celebration to a whole new level for me. It was amazing seeing everyone come together to celebrate this as you would in NYE style in New York, or London. Working speaking English all the time, you forget the ethnic Chinese roots here are very strong and so are the traditions, with a bit of local flavor.</p>
      <p>As a tangent (heading towards a secant), a friend from high school happened to be in Singapore when I arrived. I had eaten dinner with her previously at a Sanpoutei Ramen shop in Holland Village, Singapore, and she invited me to meet with her for NYE. So, I rolled into this new year with an old friend from high school -- one of those that you weren't good friends with but knew of, and never thought would be connected again -- as well as my partner, and our roommate (who, again, we weren't super close with in London but we never thought we'd be united in Singapore). The world works in such a unique way; don't ever close a door to reconnect with old friends.</p>
      <p>Happy year of the Sheep!&nbsp;</p>
