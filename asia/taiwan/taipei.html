      <h2>TAIPEI, TAIWAN</h2>
      <h4>2015-10-25, 20:35, JASON</h4>
      <h4>STAY: MY UNCLE'S</h4>
      <p>‍</p>
      <p>The last time I was in Taipei was 2011. Since then, I've graduated from my BSc, my MSc, and have lived in 3 different countries. Coming back and seeing everyone this time was a big treat, since I have not seen them since 2011. They'd visited numerous times in the past but I was always away.</p>
      <p>I arrived in Taipei airport at 05:30, and took the bus into 天母 (Tian Mu), which is where my cousins lived. In the past, I've always had family pick me up but this time I insisted on taking the bus just to get a new perspective on the city. So, naturally, I fell asleep on the bus ride.</p>
      <p>The only day that I got to do tourist stuff was that Friday when arriving. My mom had been there and I had not seen her for about 6 months as well, so that was a treat in itself getting to catch up. We went to Chiang Kai Shek's memorial, looked at some museums, watched a change of guard, and then headed up to 新北投 (Xin Bei Tou) to check out some of the hot springs and the nature. The weather was autumnal and stunning, I don't think I have been in weather cooler than 30 celsius since moving to Singapore! Nice sunshine and a relaxed atmos.. kind of like California, actually. In the past, I only went during the summer with its heat, and so this time around had a different feel to it.</p>
      <p>Refreshing catching up with my family whom I hadn't seen seen in what seems like forever. Of course, they're happy to know you're doing well and navving your own way somehow. The other nights were spent with my mom's college friends (who, upon meeting, I realized were very similar to my college friends a bit in the gossip and drinking) as well as other various family members. I'll definitely be coming back sometime soon, and I'll take Thorin next time so he can see what it's all about.&nbsp;</p>
