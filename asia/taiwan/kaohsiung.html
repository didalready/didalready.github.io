      <h2>KAOHSIUNG, TAIWAN</h2>
      <h4>2015-10-25, 17:30, JASON</h4>
      <h4>STAY: MY PARENTS</h4>
      <p>‍</p>
      <p>This trip was a bit special. Not only was it Thorin's first time to Taiwan, it was also in celebration of my dad's 60th birthday. It seems like not too long ago when our parents were young, active beings, but now they're all retiring and we're all just getting started. LA VIDA.</p>
      <p>Anyway, after the birthday dinner celebration (in which we surprised our dad, he had no idea we'd be there), we did some touristy stuff. As it is with family, they just shuttle you around everywhere so you lose track really quickly about where you actually go. So, the pictures are relatively scattered. I remember we went on the "Ai4 He2" which is the love river, some boat cruise tour, but I was too tired (maybe drunk) to pay attention. We also went to the top of some hill and got a really cool view of Kaohsiung. After that, they took us to this place to get shaved ice. No joke, the BIGGEST one I've ever had in my life. It wasn't even edible among 10 people. Mostly just took pictures but had a blast with that&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The next day was a more quiet one. My parents took us to one of the nicer train stations in Kaohsiung (forgot the name) as well as a hipster art district via the MRT. I think it used to be a train station that was converted for tourism purposes. Since my dad loves beer we went to a shop that had a bunch of artisinal import beer and we just drank in the afternoon. At night, we went to a live bar and had a bunch of beer and snacks with my family. Super good fun!&nbsp;</p>
