      <h2>What's Democracy?</h2>
      <h4>2018-01-15, 13:00, JASON</h4>
      <p>‍</p>

<p>The Wild Lily student movement (野百合學運) was a student demonstration in 1990 for democracy in Taiwan. Approximately one year after the Tiananmen Square (天安門) incident in China, the movement eventually led to a series of democratization reforms in Taiwan. The demonstrated lasted from March 16 to 22. 

<p>This is a second installment to my series of posts from the ABC (American-born Chinese) perspective. The first can be seen <a href="../abc/abc.html"> HERE </a>. This time, I’m attempting to string together loose thoughts on democracy: what it means, why people cherish it, while some don’t. And, how, to an ABC, the concept is familiar yet oddly foreign, but slowly making sense.

<p>I start from what I know, which is the American education system. We are taught very young that the U.S. is the “Land of the Free, Home of the Brave.” We stand up and salute a flag in the name of “Liberty, and Justice for All.” We love our need for free speech and expression, and will die by it before we combat more pressing issues in the U.S. such as deeply entrenched racism and growing income inequality. Plaster that with some eagles (bald), a old red, white, blue, and some stars, and you have Freedom. Democracy equates to Freedom. 

<p>We wear our badge of freedom with pride. We look to the outside world and see how people should be like us. Our government pushes our agenda to the developing world, assisting in democratization efforts in the hopes that poor brown and black folks can have a taste of life in our sweet ivory tower. This all-encompassing idea of freedom unites us  <i> Americans  </i> of the same melting pot. Native, Black, Latino, Asian, and other minority American people will often extol their freedoms in America, eulogizing it into the U.S. historical fabric. We hang the phrase of freedom and freedom of speech on our tongues and are readily able to unleash it on any dissenter.

<p>But, what do we understand of freedom, if it’s all we know? What of democracy, if it’s all we experience? If you want to know about water, you don’t ask the fish, you ask the human who struggles to survive in it. When we bathe in concepts and, as our adaptive bodies and minds numb to complacency and <i> status quo </i>, we often take for granted the rights guaranteed by democracy. We forget what democracy has given to us – the right to vote. Our approval to form a social contract with our representatives – whether local representatives, state senators, House congressmen, President – to do their job of representing us. A first line of defense against the current president (Trump) is: “He does not represent America.” 

<p>I’ve never harped on about democracy. I don’t care much for it, because I’m accustomed to the privilege of it. But maybe that perpetuates the complacency many Americans have for it. As forms of government go, my perspective is that not governments, but <i> governance </i> matters. Good governance matters. And, not only that, good governance is hard. But, in Hong Kong and Taiwan, democracy does matter to some. And, to those some that it matters to, it matters a lot. They will also wear democracy and freedom on their tongue and spit it out to dissenters -- I’m beginning to understand why, the longer I live in Greater China.

<p>Unlike the American variety of unleashing democracy as a be-all-end-all form of government, in Greater China, they fought for it, and continue to defend it. I’ve been in conversations with Hong Kongers that say they are an open society; a free society. Their government is incredibly transparent and document many of the proceedings happening internally. Transparency is key. When large policy proposals are introduced, a public consultation (adopted from the British) via public and electronic avenues are opened so citizens can voice their concerns. Why? Because, when your Chief Executive (the Presidential equivalent in Hong Kong) is not elected by the people, it severely undermines its legitimacy. This is my first realization: if you can’t vote for someone to represent you, how can you trust that they will? Why does democracy matter to Hong Kongers? It’s a matter of legitimacy and trust, which, after voting them in, how much the chosen government represents you. If you don’t trust your government, who can you trust? Is trusting your goverment all that important? This spawns two points:

<p>First, you have Big Brother, the People’s Republic of China, across the Futian (福田) and Luohu (羅湖) borders in the north of Hong Kong. The Chinese Communist Party (CPC) has managed to obtain incredible amounts of legitimacy without direct vote. How? Economic development. You take China, and for those that have been there, the pace and development of cities is incredible. People have a great standard of life (I’ll save the high Gini coefficient politics for another post). They also have an incredibly efficient life. The government is all-provisional, an omnipotent, visible hand that carefully structures economic and social development; the former moreso than the latter. Again, 天安門 – <i> Tiananmen.</i> You ask the average Chinese person whether they support the CPC and they’ll say yes. It doesn’t make them 愛國 – patriotic – necessarily, but their government has done well – economically at least. It has also convinced its public that economic development is foremost most important. This is an example of good governance, with ‘good’ being loosely defined along financial means. 

<p>Second, when you have no legitimacy in your government as in Hong Kong, you get a strong civil society. Governance without government. A ‘grassroots governance’ among the people that you can trust. It's a different take on the visible hand. And you really do see it, if you look. I had the pleasure of visiting 仁愛堂, Yan Oi Tong, a Hong Kong mega-NGO who provides services for impoverished youth and elders, and elders abandoned by their families. The staff are grassroots workers who care about their society. Some of them are elder volunteers themselves. I was amazed at the amount of societal integration. People in their 40s and 50s, working hard to provide for their society in place of a lackluster welfare state. It was an anthill that functioned from resilience of the volunteers and staff. In fact, this is not a unitary case. I also visited the Boys’ Brigade, another NGO similar to America’s Boy Scouts of America, whom, when interviewing one manager and assistant manager in charge, showed incredible dedication to the success and development of adolescent boys in Hong Kong. And, although faced with financial constraints, consistently found new ways to secure funding fixated on their aim. I have never paid attention to the knit of society elsewhere. This contrasted with what my experience has been for friends that say Hong Kong is a shallow society. In my experience up in the New Territories, I have found that, on the grassroots level, they’re incredibly dedicated and passionate. The average-joe in Hong Kong is hardworking and industrious. And this is painstakingly so in the face of the struggles of growing up in Hong Kong. It’s not easy to grow up in Hong Kong; the poverty, the income gap, the housing prices. But despite this, there is still a society to take care of. 

<p>Democracy, maybe insofar as to say freedom, to a Hong Konger is the ability to organize to create a sustainable society. It’s a means organizing among themselves to create stronger self-governance. It’s an alley towards staying robust and resilient against Big Brother’s slow integration of them – physically (the new Hong Kong, Guanzhou, Macau Bridge being built) and economically (Hong Kong’s economy is heavily supported by China). But, god forbid ever socially. Democracy is the last stand. You take that away, you're China. The thing that is not China-ese is the resilience of the Hong Kong people; the Lion Rock Spirit. That identity is linked to democracy. And, identity is robust. Democracy is identity.

<p> In the same way, anti-democracy is essential to Chinese modern identity. "Socialism with Chinese Characteristics" is how they describe it. 
I like to ask Chinese people why Taiwan and Hong Kong are part of China. I ask because I’m curious, not to provoke them. I was doing a comparison once on Singapore and Hong Kong, and used the word “countries” when comparing them. A girl raised her hand at the end and said, “I don’t think it’s right that you used the word ‘country’ to describe Hong Kong.” To, which, if it were a private setting, I would have said, “Yes, but imagine for a second if it were a country. How would that look?” Re-imagining Hong Kong and Taiwan’s position as separate is not only a mental exercise, but impossible to do so for many China-ese. Still, it’s an interesting endeavour. Democracy, a concept in China that almost holds the same detest as communism does in America, is low on their priorities. You don’t necessarily need a voice in a country where the government has provided everything, and has provided it well. Good citizenry is second to good governance. The government is all provisional. And, for me, that line of thought is OK. The CPC’s means to legitimacy is its own means. I no longer taste the words Communism or Socialism on the American palette. The way Chinese government works is efficient. My only complaint is it retards society, socially. 

<p>And so, economic efficiency and social 'progress' are at a tradeoff in China. 

<p>Now, for Taiwan. Have you seen videos of the Legislative Yuan (立法院) of Taiwan in progress? This is the equivalent to the legislature (Congress) in the U.S. Bloody brawls on the Legislative floor as legislators get their issues heard. Forget Civilization for a while, this is politics in its purest form. When you can’t be asked to engage, you raise your voice to outscream your opponent. If that doesn’t work, you throw a punch to get heard. It’s simple. Some would argue it's unproductive. Yeah, it probably is. Democracy in Taiwan, some have hargued, have hindered progress as a country. But, I will say it’s passionate. Do you see the National People’s Congress in China (their form of Congress)? Many representatives are there merely for face, and for a vote of approval which will be obtained anyway. Where’s the punching? Where's the passion and dedication? Am I not seeing it because I’m not looking hard enough, or because they are too rare? I refuse to believe they don’t exist. They must exist somewhere behind that Great Firewall; somewhere amidst the political silence.

<p>Democracy is a new system in Taiwan. Following Chiang Ching Kuo’s slow permission of other parties and the democratization of Taiwan, they have smoothly transitioned to democracy and elected their president. Although many elders will still praise the Martial Law days and economic productivity – the so called “authoritarian advantage” – many young Taiwanese will cherish democracy as it is a new-born entity. They weren’t born into the sea of democracy like I was in the U.S. They’ve had to nurse it and defend it as the first true democracy in Asia – for that, they are proud. Look at the Sunflower movement (they love flowers). Students stormed the Legislative Yuan and camped out to be heard protesting against trade laws with China. That dedication to improve your society is what democracy stands for.

<p>The history of the Republic of China is littered with tragedy. Taiwan’s economy is slowly fading. The days of export-led economy of bicycles and IT are tough. There aren’t enough jobs for the young people, prompting them to go towards China to find jobs. Internationally, they’re slowly becoming irrelevant as smaller countries are slowly turning to Beijing and leaving Taiwan in the dust. They are the “Orphan of Asia.” “But,” a friend said to me once, “at least we’re free.”

<p>Why do people in Taiwan care about freedom and democracy? It's made society robust. It’s one that has been born out of destruction of an old regime imported by the Kuomintang and represents a New Taiwan. Like I said, identity is robust. It has helped consolidate an identity of Taiwanese, distinguishing it from other countries in Asia. It’s made a society that has contributed vibrantly to art and literature – hallmarks of what we would call ‘culture.’ And, there’s been organic genesis in it. When we talk about the sustainability and long-term presence of nations, this is why democracy matters to Taiwan. It’s all about the long-term. Democracy is an offspring that they want to protect and nurture. They want to watch it mature. It’s their means to stay relevant and be socially enlightened. It also has a distinct Asian flavour. In some sense, it’s a beacon not only for its citizens, but as a model for democracy in Asia. If Deng Xiaoping’s Reform and Opening have redefined a Chinese model of socialism, what is to say Taiwan cannot define the Taiwan version of democracy -- Chinese with democratic characteristics? What does democracy look like in Asia, and how does it conceptually differ than that of the West? This is also a logical exercise but interesting endeavor. Deng Xiaoping said, “Black cat, white cat, it doesn’t matter; so long as it catches mice.” Taiwan’s democracy is the same. It’s imperfect and progress is slow, but, it functions as a fully fledged democracy. The people think how they do. This is why I feel Taiwan is not China, there is a political overtone that changes the way society thinks and functions. 

<p>I took this next part from Wikipedia since it personifies the Wild Lily well, and I couldn’t be bothered to find my own words. Some scholar said the Wild Lily was chosen due to its “grace and resilience,”, and its metaphor of “simplicity and fortitude.” This essentializes the Asian identity of docility, humility, but steadfastness. The longer I stay here, the more I appreciate this quality in the ethnic Chinese. Democratization is a long, arduous process. It’s painstaking and often violent. It requires an ‘awakening’ of its citizens; a foundation of democratic-protecting institutions; a consolidation of the ideology among its people, and support from the government. Taiwan was able to do it in 15 years, with little bloodshed. Hong Kong doesn’t have full democracy but fights tirelessly for it despite the uphill struggle. You want to know why democracy matters, come live in the Greater China Region. There are so many Wild Lilies in bloom.
