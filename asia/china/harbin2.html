     Our first stop this morning was St. Sophia's Cathedral. Harbin, the modern city, was developed by the Russians and heralded as an industrial base back when the Chinese Eastern Railway was being developed. As such, there is a considerable influence of Russian culture on many aspects of the city. The architecture has a Russian style to it, which I can't really describe. I'll just categorize it as having a distinct, Euro-vibe. The bright colors painted on, and a bit more intricacy on the face of the building. The more distinguishing Russian architecture style I can describe is their churches.
    </p>
    <p>
     Russian Orthodox Churches are spottable from far away. Something about their domed roofs and general upright structure, stern and pious, stick out wherever you are. The apex of the domb or sharply sloping roofs are always stamped with a cross, and the dome is often painted in some bold color. We've seen some other Orthodox churches during our time in Eastern Europe, but we've never had the joy of experiencing it in the dead cold of winter in cold conditions. We've especially not seen it in the backdrop of an industrial Chinese city. On our walk there, I notice the pavements are largely coated with a thin layer of ice and so it's quite slippery. Despite this, people seem to shuffle along and not be bothered by this normal occurrence. When we get there, there are already a bunch of tourists ready to go in.
    </p>

     I take a few pictures before going. Something about the Russianness of the church, mixed with the slight smog that was settling in, along with the bitter winter and pitter patter of snow made the church feel very 'in place.' The architecture was as stern as you'd imagine a Russian church to be. It was built out of burnt colored brick, standing by itself in the middle of the square within a radius of about 50 meters. The domes were painted in some dark teal color, anchored on top by a gold cross. There was a thin layer of snow sprinkled on the rooftop that had either frozen over or refused to melt. There were so many tourists who had come to appreciate this feat of European architecture. We bought tickets to go inside.

    </figure>
    <p>
     Another unique experience going to this church is the unique lack of church within its walls. When we walk in past the thick, padded flaps like you see in the supermarkets into the church, we're surprised to see that it's just been converted into a museum. There is actually no longer any altar (usually these churches don't have pews, in our experience). Rather, it's just been converted into an old museum to document the history of the church as well as the Harbin area. The walls are intact from their initial state, and the wooden floor below has been redone. There is heater blasting into the central bit, likely explaining why there are so many people inside. We make our rounds, reading up on the history, then bounce.

     When we head outside, we decide to do another stroll down 中央大街, ZhongYang Main Street, to see what the tourist street looks like in the morning. It's a totally different vibe. There are still many people, but nothing's lit up. The markets don't seem as bustling, and the ice sculptures look oddly out of place, just blocks of ice on the street. We head towards the Flood Management Monument that we saw the previous night. On the way, we see a group of workers in their thick down jackets, with no particular coordination as to the color; they could have been a random group of uncles for all I knew. They are carrying huge chainsaws and look quite burly, and are in charge of constructing the ice sculptures placed on ZhongYang street. I hear the chainsaw rustle and start up, and watch them cut through large blocks of ice in a straight line. When the ice is cut, it is pulled up via a small rope up a slope. In order to stack the blocks, a small pool of water is formed on top of the stacked block with an open flame, and then the next block is hoisted up onto it, such that the surface tension of water allows them to stick. Most people don't pay any attention, but I stand and watch them for a few minutes just to see how the process is done. These are the guys that have made the street what it is.

     The Songhua is also different during the day. There are probably more people on it than the night before, but there are no sparklers or lanterns. Instead, there are people being dragged around on the snow in a life-raft ish boat by cars, in 'banana boat' style. There are also some chair skiing, the same that we saw outside Shenyang Imperial Tomb. What it is, essentially, is a wooden chair with a metal frame that can glide easily on ice with the help of two metal poles. Quite literally 'chair skiing.' Other than those activities, I'm not sure what other people are doing. I think the novelty is just to be able to say that you walked on a river in the winter. Most people seem to just be having a chat and standing around.
    </p>

    <p>
     Along the banks of the Songhua River, there is a park called Stalin Park (how fittingly Russian), and Thorin and I take a stroll down towards the cable car. There are some guys here too making ice sculptures, and we soon realize that there are just these things scattered around the entire city (we later would see one outside Harbin Main Station). True to its nickname, Harbin really was an "ice city." Anyway, we decide the cable car is too expensive and so we head back to our hostel. On the way back, I take a few pictures of the Russian Architecture I was talking about - the kind I couldn't describe. On one side of the street, there is Russian architecture, and directly opposite, the standard anonymous Chinese housing complex.

    <p>
     We lounge around in the hostel because today is our journey to 冰雪大世界, or, Winter Wonderland. This place is one of three sites to see ice sculptures, and falls under the umbrella term of the Harbin International Snow and Ice Festival. Every year they will start showing in about December and, depending on weather conditions, will last until it's too warm for the sculptures to stay, well, sculptures. It's perhaps one of the most well-known ice sculpture 'festivals' globally, with other notable ones being in Japan, Canada, and Norway. But of course, with the rise of China, they gotta make it bigger and better than everyone else. All the ice is sourced from the Songhua River, and so it makes it a truly local experience. There are people from all over China who come to this city just to view these ice sculptures and, after going, I can see why.
    </p>
    <p>
     The story of the place really begins with how we decide to get there. For some reason, Thorin and I always find ourselves walking to places because we enjoy walking, so we decide to walk across the Songhua River to the Ice Festival. We ask the people in our hostel whether or not we can cross the Songhua and, in an almost Chinese fashion they say, "why not?" I feel like in the West we always ask for permission and follow the rules. In Singapore, it's similar, there are rules to be followed, and we always ask permission. However, in China, if you're breaking the law or doing something you're 'not supposed to' be doing, someone will tell you. If no one tells you though, I assume it's fine. I recall that one time in Beijing I saw some old guy just swimming in Qianhai, near the old Beijing district. He was just swimming through this pond. That nonchalance or perhaps disconcern for the law sheds a certain amount of light to how the Chinese are, and I appreciate this open, carefree human nature of them. So anyway, our hostel staff say, "Yeah, of course you can." so we assume it's walkable. I confirm this (bah, so untrusting) with a policeman at the Songhua River and he says you can walk across.
    </p>

     The walk across is nice. The further you make it out to the center of the river, the density of people lightens. Pretty soon, it's just Thorin and I out on the River. In front of us is the other side, dimly lit with those orange-tinged lamps, and behind us, the brightly fluorescent lamp-lit Songhua which we have come to know so well. You can still see the faint sparklers and lanterns on the entry side. In front of us, there's no life. There isn't a soul out on the other side, and it seems to be a scene out of a Doystoyevsky novel, The Stranger. When we are almost at the other bank, we come across a family who is now walking in the direction opposite us, towards the crowds. I ask them, "Excuse me, do you know how much further to the Winter Wonderland?" And, they look a bit confused and say, "You can't walk to the Winter Wonderland from here. It's a lot further down, you're better taking a taxi from the other side as it'll be much faster."
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, man. When I asked earlier if we could walk across the Songhua to get to Winter Wonderland, the "yeses" meant that, sure, you could walk across the river. I thought the question implied that we'd be able to also walk to the Winter Wonderland from there. We still could, but it would take about another two hours. Thorin and I looked at each other. It was about 6:30. Two hours would bring us to 8:30, and the Wonderland closed at 9:30. We often find ourselves in situations like these, but we just thought to keep going. No point stopping now. I thanked them and we finally crossed the Songhua onto the other side. It was still dead, and stil lit by the orange lamps along the pedestrianized pathway. There were some buildings there that were built in the style of St. Sophia's Cathedral, but they looked absolutely empty. Wasn't quite sure what they were, exactly, but some of them also had these weird little statues out the front. It was like out of a horror movie. I imagine in the day they'd look quite nice and, if anything, could be a summer home since it looked isolated and fancy. But, today, in the dead cold of night freezing my ass off, I couldn't wait to keep walking. So, I took a picture for memories and then Thorin and I continued down the empty road.

     There was a thin layer of snow powder as we kept walking. We eventually made it to a small neighborhood with a cluster of houses, and a man who was in the back of his van cleaning it out just out front. He was with a few friends who were sipping beer and chatting on the front porch. I asked him if we can walk to the Winter Wonderland, and he said, "sure, just keep walking down this road." I, again, double check with a lady who is walking her dog down the street maybe about 200 meters down. Then, the real answer:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, .. wait, where did you come from? Why didn't you just take a taxi from the other side of the river? It's much faster. If you are here, you will have to walk another two hours (1.5 hours fast walk) to get there. By then, it'll probably be almost closed." Ouch, a spear to the heart. But I then said, "OK, forget the taxi. If we were to walk, how do we get there?" She proceeded to give us directions. Cross a bridge. Once you hit the end, make a U-turn and follow the road. Then, from there, ask someone. So we follow her directions. We make it out of the little neighborhood and follow a deserted road until we come across a small bridge that arched over a smaller arm of the Songhua River. We made the U-turn, and began walking down a long road. We were the only ones out there for a while. Some cars drove by us; taxis as well; but we just kept walking, while the temperature just got colder. We came across a small park, so it would seem that there was some sign of life, but that night there were only the two of us. Everything else was just silence.
    </p>
    <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center">

      <img src="images/harbin2_18.JPG"/>
     </div>
    </figure>
    <p>
     Eventually, we make it to what looks like a tollbooth, and a single man working the tollbooth. I ask him how to get to the Winter Wonderland exhibit (at this point, it's starting to sound a bit like some exotic, foreign place that we'll never find). He says, "Oh, you're close, just follow this road up and you'll get there." Our eyes light up a bit at his response, and it's as if we get a reinvigoration of spirit instantaneously. We continue to walk. The lights from the tollbooth fade off into the background as we are engulfed by the silence once again. Soon enough, any sign of there being a 'neighborhood' disappears, and we enter into what seems to be a densely forested area, only paved by the single lane road passing through, of which we are walking on the side of. We then come across this sign that tells the directions of two places, neither of which is Winter Wonderland. We stand at this intersection for a while, and see that most cars are making the left turn down the un-lit road. But, we're conflicted of the advice given to us at the toll booth to just 'follow the road up.' Eventually, we decide to take this left turn based on what we're seeing, and ignore the advice. I try to pull out my phone to use it but my hands are absolutely frozen over, so we just decide to trust ourselves and walk. I mean, worst comes to worst, we could always flag down one of the cars that were driving by.
    </p>
    <p>
     Down the road, we're surrounded by evergreen trees on both sides. There are no lights so we steer clear of the middle of the road and try not to slip from the various small puddles of water that have frozen over on the side of the road. It's not completely pitch black as the light pollution seems to tricke down ever so slightly, and the moonlight also illuminates the way. There's peace in the air, being there just with your best friend and walking down. There's tranquility there too, being able to stand still and only hear the highway off in some far distance. And, there's the journey; being able to be lost on the way and out of control, but just going with it and letting go. I will remember this moment for a long time, I tell myself. A few cars pass by. They're likely wondering what a random Chinese person and white person are doing in the middle of the woods, but here we are, enjoying ourselves. We keep walking.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally we make it to a busier road, where we see some cars driving. The orange lights are back and the street is lit. Off in the distance you can see some sort of lit up area that has some commotion - we thought we might be close. Taking that random left turn down the road might have just been worth it.
    </p>
    <p>
     As we approach the lights, we see a hilarious sign. "Welcome to Sun Island, again." Sun Island is the area that we had been walking around for the past hour, which is just the plot of land directly across the Songhua River from where we came. We knew we were on the island since we saw a bunch of signs pointing in its direction. But, this sign was just hilarious. We had been lost for the better half of an hour, and Fate would stick this sign right in front of us to mock us, possibly telling us that we had just taken a long way around and had been circling around the island for the past hour in the freezing cold. I tried to snap a picture of it, but even our camera battery had drained out from the intense cold and it would not turn on for even a second to focus and capture the shot. Thorin and I just kind of chuckled to each other, "Well, at least we know where we are for sure now. Again."
    </p>
    <p>
     But, as Christmas miracles would happen (or, New Years miracles), as we hit the end of the street and entered one of those massive main Chinese roads that we were used to now seeing, we saw these bright, industrial lights shining against a large statue made out of packed snow. On it were some Chinese characters , and below it, something along the lines of "...snow exposition." I almost fell to my knees. We'd made it to the main road. Winter Wonderland wasn't so far away.
    </p>
    <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center">
     <div>
      <img src="images/harbin2_19.JPG"/>
     </div>
    </figure>
    <p>
     But, it was. It was about another mile down the road. It was already 8:20 or so, and we knew the place was closing soon so we were debating whether or not to take a bus or a cab across to the front. But, we knew that standing and waiting for a taxi or bus would've taken longer than to just walk, so we gathered our frozen limbs together for the last haul. At this point, we really realize how big these Chinese roads are. It's difficult to jay-walk across them due to the sheer size and expansiveness. We cross through an underground passage and head down a road that finally leads to the 冰雪大世界, Winter Wonderland. There are some taxis crowded around the front. But, we finally made it. I tuck my camera within the jacket to heat it up so the battery can warm up a bit. We buy our overpriced tickets (330 Yuan at the time!) and spend the next hour trying to make it through one of the world's largest snow and ice exhibits.
    </p>
    <p>
     The place is incredible. There are towers built with ice, castles built with ice, Buddhas built with snow, and large exhibits of random stuff carved into a densely packed snow. There are small slides strewn around everywhere and, for a small price, you can buy a mini toboggan to slide down the things. They are selling the famous gourd frozen candy sticks outside as well. It's like an ice theme park and thousands of people are just gathered there to play in the snow. Yes, play. One thing I've always admired about the Chinese is their ability to feel comfortable in situations where playing is involved. We saw it with the tour group that was wrestling in the snow at the Great Wall, and we were seeing it here. Adults and children alike were enjoying the snow, and various parts of the ice sculptures in which they could walk on. Couples were flirting within the castle grounds, and kids were running around in their thick bundle of jackets, unafraid to fall. There was a long queue to go down the 'longest slide' in the park and people had the perseverance to wait out in the snow just for 30 seconds of fun. There were people taking pictures everywhere. There were people enjoying themselves at every opportunity they could because it was the Harbin Ice and Snow International fucking Festival.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rest is probably better told through pictures. From a purely engineering perspective, it was really something to be admired. I mean, the whole place was made out of ice. Even some of the staircase railings were made of ice. Like, what??

     So, we had about an hour to see the whole place. Perhaps an hour was not eonugh because I felt like we could've stayed there for another 30 minutes, but the people slowly began to trickle out. As they did, that's when it got really fun. That's when people were just taking their mini toboggans and sliding down any old slope they could find. There were no more rules; 'long slope of snow' was a perfectly good reason to just go down it with a toboggan. People began just being more free and getting their last intake of snow in for themselves before they had to leave. There must've been a 20 or 30 meter tall slide that people were going down in twos and threes just to see what it was like. We were determined to stay there until the last minute of closing since we spent the last hour and a half trying to get here, as well as so much money on the entry ticket. As we left, we had a feeling or sense of accomplishment. We walked across the river and through the 'desert' to get here. We got to see Winter Wonderland. We got to see one of the best engineering feats of China, and one of the new cultural spots in China. The time trekking through to get here faded off into the distance as the laughter and joy of the Chinese filled the air.

     When we got out, it was taxi-tout central. So many people trying to get you to go back with them. None of them would have wanted to 打表, run the taxi meter, they all wanted to negotiate a price. We left the park entrance and tried to hail a cab down the main road. Being pretty good at the bargaining game, he gave an initial offer of 50. No thanks. We offered a firm 20 RMB (4 SGD, 2.75 USD) for the ride back, which was about 6 km. He said no way, if he were to turn on the meter he could get more. So I said fine, and left. The next man shows up offering 40, we stick to our guns. We see a group of guys in front of us who had started negotiating with the guy we just turned down. They, a group of 4, decide to get in, but the man says to them that they can't take their minitoboggan with them. In the Chinese Way, they just toss it on the side of the road and abandon it into the snow. Poor toboggan.

     We eventually negotiate a price with this fierce Dong Bei driver, and he agrees to 20, maybe a bit reluctantly. It's the end of the night and the last trip, so we had that on our side. You can tell he's kind of pissed, maybe based on the fact that he doesn't want to talk, but it's still money to be made. When he drops us off though, it's almost as if he does a 180. He wishes us a safe journey, and for us to watch out when opening the doors. He turns on a certain charm and manners as if bidding farewell to guests. Maybe he never did do a 180, maybe that's just the nature of Chinese bargaining. Yes, when you're negotiating it's all business, but it so quickly diffuses. If I got ripped off in a deal I would always foster a bit of mild resentment, especially if I had to share a ride with him for the next 20 minutes. But he seemed to not mind so much. He told us to take care and we gave him the 20 dollars - a reminder of our bargain. He happily took the money and then went on his way.
