      <h2>HARBIN, HEILONGJIANG, CHINA</h2>
      <h3>DAY 10: LAODAOWAI (老道外), ST. SOPHIA'S CATHEDRAL, ZHONGYANG STREET</h3>
      <h4>2017-02-16, 11:24, JASON</h4>
      <h4><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-wR2s2IVNQhhxj-0irDpt_ntnFAhj694yjaQeTBhnGc/edit?usp=sharing">BUDGET&nbsp;</a>, STAY: KAZU INTERNATIONAL HOSTEL</h4>
      <p>‍</p>
      <p>老道外, LaoDaoWai, is Harbin's older more industrial quarters. Thus far, we've only been around the more centralized, newer tourist area consisting of ZhongYang Main Street as well as the Songhua River. Most people will prefer to stay in this area as there's more shopping and it's commercially relevant. However, a few will also choose to stay in LaoDaoWai.</p>
      <p>Chinese cities are at a crossroads. They're constantly trying to juggle what is culturally Chinese versus economic development. Most often, cultural relics have been sacrificed at the expense of development since, well, culture doesn't really feed people. I've admired this about the Chinese mindset in development, that a certain standard of living must happen before fostering their cultural history. We in the west would likely scoff at this notion, that 'culture' must be preserved at every step, but these are just two different sides of looking at the issue of what it means to be "developed." I write about this conflict a lot, the need to be a global superpower, and at the same time keeping on to tradition. I think the Chinese have tried very hard to balance the two, although tipping more in favor (at the government level, at least) towards development.</p>
      <p>The product of said dissonance is places like LaoDaoWai. It's a hipster street now, and a place you can go to see a bit of "Old Harbin" before it became this commercial place known for ice sculptures. It's made even more hipster-y when you feel like you're walking through an old Hutong like the ones in Beijing, but you realize that a lot of the buildings have been recently built or refurbished to model the Old Look. This is mostly accomplished by building a lot of things out by some dark grayish stone with some Chinese-ish inspired designs etched onto the street. It's done beautifully, and I still get that Chinese essence while walking down the street, but you know it's artificial. All in all, though, that's OK. Step outside of LaoDaoWai, nicely streamlined into "three easy to walk streets", and you'll see the older industrial Harbin.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Today, LaoDaoWai is very quiet. There is very little foot traffic. We took the 1 bus to get here and the total journey time was about 15 minutes through the traffic. It's about 14:00 now, the sun will be setting around 16:30, and so we have a few hours to walk around before the lights come on, and we get yet another version of the place.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>There are some classic red lanterns as well as some modern pastel lanterns strung from window to window across the old buildings. Everyone else who's not working in the shops or selling off something are tourists, and even then, there aren't many people out in the middle of winter. In fact, even though there are people in the shops, given how quiet it is I would be led to believe that in fact, there wasn't even anyone tending to the shops. The classic "Hu Lu" gourd candies-on-a-stick are being sold, and we come across a man also selling sheets of honeycomb by the 5-Yuan. It's freezing, but he's making a good salesman. His business depends on it, and so he's out there in a thick Russian style hat, braving the weather, asking if we want honeycomb.&nbsp;</p>
      <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center">

      <p>The Chinese do a sale in the oddest way. It's a mix and match of speaking a lot, and then also acting like they didn't hear what you said at the right moments. He says he's selling it by the five yuan, so we say we want 5 yuan worth. Instead of cutting us 5 yuan worth, he asks us how much we want (ignoring that we said we wanted a 5 Yuan portion). He gestures with his knife across the honeycomb sheet, "This much?" I say, "No, that's too much, maybe a little less."</p>
      <p>In that moment, I've switched from asking for a 5 Yuan portion to asking for a given portion on the honeycomb sheet, which, may or may not equate to 5 Yuan. He acts like I didn't gesture how much, and he tries to convince me to take a larger slice, "No, that won't be enough. How about this?" But, I'm quite firm on this. I reroute the conversation back to saying I only want 5 Yuan worth, so I think that slice should be enough. He then switches it to, "No no, your portion is too small. Let me just cut it here in this direction so my sheet is even for the next customer (it was initially a square, and I wanted a diagonal piece off). I say, "fine, fine." and he happily cuts away at his honeycomb sheet, and crumbles it a bit for us, then puts it in a bag. He weighs it with a sensitive scale, as the honeycomb is light, and then he says, "10 RMB." I'd normally be a bit miffed, but, it's really not much money, I've gotten a great interaction out of it, and the guy has made an extra 5 Yuan. It's tough business out here.</p>
      <p>Throughout the street there are also bronze statues depicting everyday life in the old LaoDaoWai. They are pretty standard activities of the day, like cutting hair, etc. but it gives a peek into what the older generations used to do here, and what the significance of LaoDaoWai was. You can tell in the summer it's probably a very cool street to hang out in and grab a few drinks, as there are small booths that sell food, all boarded up for the season. There's a calmness in the air, as the pollution slowly hovers.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>While we are there we see this kid that's talking to an uncle running an ice cream cart. He's clearly a white kid, but maybe looks like he could be mixed. I don't know, in these border regions there's probably a larger range of looks. I see him talking to the uncle in Chinese about getting a SIM card. Cool! A white kid (who looks local) in China running around talking to people in Chinese. I think he's some sort of community kid, maybe one of the token white kids who stroll around LaoDaoWai - Harbin does have a western influence. As we continue walking, we come across a shop selling Russian goods. There are a lot of these shops around all over DongBei given the heavy Russian influence. But, given the Chinese influence, there could be a lot that are also fake goods - pawning off Russian commodities like their chocolate and famous nesting dolls. When we walk into this shop, a wispy woman, wrinkly in the face but nevertheless wearing a smile that breaks through the facade of age greets us. She's quite spindly, her hair a mousy brown. The shop looks closed, there are no lights on despite it being 14:30 or so now and with low visibility of the suns rays. This, coupled with some shelves that are blocking the window, make the place rather dark. In the center of the shop there are tables laid out with small plastic boxes that you usually get at the Chinese takeouts. Small, rectangular, flimsy pieces of plastic that seal together with that 'click click click' for a tight seal of dishes that are particularly sauce heavy, except instead of being filled with Chinese food they are filled with chocolate.</p>
      <p>There are many varieties of chocolate. Ones in gold wrappers, ones in plastic, ones with labels and ones without. I feel like I'm reading through a copy of One Fish, Two Fish by Dr. Seuss, but instead of detailing aquatic biodiversity I'm looking at chocolate. The woman smiles. "This is Russian milk chocolate. Licorice flavor." She has a thick Russian accent. We say, "Cool." and proceed to engage with small talk. I'm still looking at the candy. Some boxes contain all the same candy, some contain a mixture of candies. She must have spent some time mixing and matching the different candies in the boxes. On the underside, a light neon yellow sticker indicating the price.</p>
      <p>"Here, we have Russian Vodka. All different kinds." She shows us the different bottles; from different flavors to different colors. They are distinctly authentic given a small, rectangular sticker that indicates 'approval of preparation' from the vodka factories in Russia. "You can buy this in China, yes, but if they don't have this sticker, it may not be the real thing!" She laughs. She doesn't make a jab at the Chinese in particular, neither does she specifically point their notoriety in manufacturing fake products. She's a smiley woman, smiley for a Russian I'd imagine, and she continues to show us the goods around the shop. "Here, we even have Russian fruit candies." Again, a shelf or two. "Here, we have.." and, "Here, we have.." proceeds a couple of more times until we've been standing there so long (or, what felt like so long, but was probably 5 minutes) that we feel the need to buy something. Never once has she tried to make a sale to us, like the honeycomb man earlier. She's just been showing us all these Russian things. Our dusty Cyrillic reading literacy is recharged after making our way through the scripts on the chocolates and other various products.</p>
      <p>A burly man appears behind the counter in the far end of the shop. At the far end of the shop there's a small counter, with a small menu printed on some boards up top, much like you'd find at a takeout. It's not lit. I walk towards that end of the shop and go to greet the man, but he looks like he can only speak Russian and Chinese, not English. Imagine that - to be a master of these two great languages! He barely smiles, and so I can't handle the staring and just read the sign. English, Russian Cyrillic, and Mandarin Chinese. It's like looking into the Cold War, these three dominant languages grouped side by side, all on the quaint little board-menu in a Russian Shop, in a Russian influenced Chinese city. I look at the man, and he's still just looking.</p>
      <p>We finally decide on buying some Russian ice cream. Chocolate would be hard to shuttle back.</p>
      <p>The lady and her husband are from Vladivostok, the nearest major Russian City to Harbin. According to her, it's "really close, just a 12 hour bus ride away." To any Londoner, that would be far. To any Singaporean, that would be unbearable. To me, it's still a bit far, but hey, at least you're not doing the driving. They'd been living together in Harbin for the past 20 years, and have found their home in China, and "love it. The Chinese people are great, and they have welcomed us into their home." We thank her deeply for all the introductions to all the different products, and we sit outside in the freezing weather eating our ice cream. I'll never know what possesses people to eat cold shit in a cold place, but, somehow that ice cream was oddly satisfying, albeit absolutely freezing my insides. The kid we saw earlier talking to the uncle runs into the shop and greets his mom, the owner of the shop. It all makes sense now.</p>
      <p>We continue our walk along LaoDaoWai, which has slowly become more of a ghost town. There's a thin layer of snow in some places, but other than that it's barren. It's so cold that it seems like a street that froze the industrial Chinese aura into the walls, and the streets, despite the modern construction. There are relics of old doors and signs of former life that we stop to appreciate. And, in that moment, I'm humbled at the diversity that is China.</p>
      <p>---</p>
      <p>We leave LaoDaoWai and walk outside for a bit. A lot of the buildings are so industrialiste, which is my word for 'exhibiting an industrialist flare.' We're absolutely freezing though, so we had into one of those pseudo underground markets and malls. This one is different than the other ones in Dalian and Shenyang. There's not as many people, and people are getting along with their business. As most underground malls go, there is still a food court, but seeing as it's about 15:30 there is the odd traffic of straggle-eaters between the lunch and dinner hours. We forget that it's still a work day here. We stroll around the mall and watch various people do their work: a man selling bread, a man loading sausages into the sinewy packaging material (I'm particularly fascinated by this), and a man selling all kinds of beans and herbs.&nbsp;</p>

      </figure>
      <p>When we step outside and walk further, the city slowly deteriorates. Finally, a glimpse into the 老百姓, the common hundred people, loosely translated to "common folk", lifestyle. The buildings are stripped, whether by time or by the weather or by both, it's hard to say. There's some graffiti on the wall, open wires running abroad, sleet on the streets. You still see the classic Chinese shops lining the bottom floor of the buildings, but they all look out of business or empty. It's all still functional, don't get me wrong, but it's pretty beat up.&nbsp;</p>
      <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center">

      </figure>
      <p>Now I know why the people here are so rough. The weather really shapes them. There's a mundane-ness to the city that extends down the street. It's a weird mix between modern construction buildings and Russian style buildings. We take a few pictures, then duck back into LaoDaoWai in hopes that the lanterns are lit, and they are. There's a different atmosphere when it's lit by light and not by the sun. It feels cozy, inviting; something about the warmth of a red light (save the Red Light District jokes...) that beckons you in. We find a small steamed bun restaurant that's supposedly very famous and duck in.&nbsp;</p>
      <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center">

      </figure>
      <p>"Please sir, upstairs this way." the waitress says in Chinese. When we get up, we see that it's not as crowded as below, and there are even waiters (wearing red outfits) with their heads down on a table - about three of them. As we come up, and, as the people behind us and behind them come up, one by one we see the tables get filled and the staff slowly wake up because there's customers that need seats. I love it, it's like watching pigeons flock away at the sight of people, as the sleepy workers know they probably have a long shift ahead. I wonder if they're sleeping in the back.</p>
      <p>Thorin's still feeling the after-effects of new years day and so doesn't have much of an appetite. But, here, it's like 30 Yuan for 6 buns. Anything less than that then it's really hard for the restaurant to justify why they're even seating you in the first place. So, we order 2 of each of their specialty bun. While we wait for our order, one auntie worker sits down next to us on a row of seats that seem to line one face of the wall. She sits down with a plastic bag full of garlic, and then happily smiles and then begins to peel it. When I worked back in the food hall in university, we would always try to hide food preparation in the back of the kitchen so as to give the facade of cleanliness. It's more often than not that people will not have the food process be on display as it's somehow less professional. Either that, or people don't want to see how their food is prepared. But, they want it to be clear that it is *freshly* prepared, which I find, after writing, interesting. I don't know if that's a western thing or not, but now that I think, sometimes in the East it's not such a bad thing if you see it. With the famous noodle makers in Lanzhou, they will have a glass panel so you can watch the masters pull and stretch the noodle in the same ancient tradition. In DinTaiFung, you'll see them work like little robots preparing the steamed buns (小籠包) that everyone loves. And so, here is auntie, peeling garlic.</p>
      <p>But that's perhaps not even the best part. The best part is that one of her colleagues joins her and then they begin gossiping over a bag of peeled garlic skin. Another colleague comes shortly after, curious about what they're up to. It follows like this until four women are clustered around a bag of garlic, peeling at intermittent intervals, and chatting about any X, Y, Z topic. You'd never see this in a western restaurant. And so, I take a picture because they have found solidarity through garlic peeling. It's almost so profound I can't even stand not to photograph them.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The atmosphere at night in LaoDaoWai seems to pick up a few more tourists. It's like the tea buildings in Jiufen, Taiwan the way it lights up.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>But, as we've been there for a few hours and the weather begins to drop without the sun out, we head back, and decide to get off at St. Sophia's Cathedral again. This time, we appreciate it lit up. It's not done in a magnificent way. A few 'underlights' shining up at the building, illuminating the domes and gold crosses. The windows also nest lights. The lights originating from the church in conjunction with the lights from the surrounding square give it a polished look and that night-church atmosphere, the feeling that you're going to Mass or something. Except, since it's just a museum (see previous post), you end up just admiring from the outside.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The night ends with us going back to ZhongYang street and eating all the streetfood I didn't get a chance to eat. There is a booth with a man dressed in a Santa Elf costume yelling in a thick Dongbei accent for people to buy whatever it is he's selling. It appears to be a soft drink, so I go in to buy one. His voice immediately softens to this sexy, husky voice that is calm and completely different than the man just 10 seconds earlier shouting for a sale. I ask what he's selling and he proceeds to tell me in his sultry voice that it's warm Coke, and it's kind of a weird local specialty here and it's caught on. So, I have a warm Coke, which is a flattened, hot Coca Cola beverage that tastes just like sweet syrup, but it's oddly satisfying in the weather. I thank Santa's Elf, smitten by his voice. I also get another Harbin red sausage, famous in the area. Craving some meat after walking around and.. having..... just eaten a bunch of buns not even one hour earlier. I savor every last favor as today is the last day in the wonderful, true north of China and afterwards, we'll be heading back down.&nbsp;</p>
