      <p>‍</p>
      <p>We arrive on Day 3 of our trip, 2016-12-27, from Dalian. We check into Lazybee hostel, which is the only official hostel that's opened in Shenyang. When we walk in, the fresh smell of 火鍋, hotpot, hits our noses. It smells like they're having a special spicy hotpot, the 麻辣 version. They speak a little bit to us and then ask us if we have dinner. The next thing we know, we end the night having hot pot with the owners of the hostel. There are also a couple of other friends that stop in and out while we eat, greeting us. They have handmade dumplings and of course, the Dong Bei specialty, 酸菜, sour vegetables, all available for stewing. They also have some meat ready for cooking as they invite us over to eat with them. I chat a bit with them and so does Thorin (in Chinese!), and our first night in Shenyang ends with us eating alongside them and playing some strategy game (Blockus). The hostel here is more like one of those old school hostels that serves as a meeting place / coffee shop for young people. People stop in and out for meals and games, and it's a central meeting point for young people. We're here for new years. Should be a good run.</p>
      <p>---</p>
      <p>Day 4</p>
      <p>Shenyang is the birthplace of the Qing Dynasty, and is now the capital of the Liaoning province. Before the Qing moved the capital to Beijing, it was in Shenyang. As such, there is an Imperial Palace built there, with a strong Manchu influence. It's one of the most famous sites in Shenyang and so we decided to check it out.</p>
      <p>The problem of blogging about something like the Imperial Palace is that it's difficult to capture all of the history and the entire atmosphere of the place. When you walk in, you can feel the depth of the history in the air -- it's a very intense feeling of hundreds of years of history that has been left over for us to witness. The structures are a bit 'cold' looking in the weather, but there's a romantic quality to the old buildings in the wintertime. The snow gently sits on the roof laid with bricks, and the trees in the background have all lost their leaves. There's tranquility in the open space as you take a glimpse into the old dynastic capital and how they lived. There are not many tourists since it's winter time and so you're able to walk for a few minutes without encountering others, an even if you do there's only a few other people taking pictures and snaking their way through history. And, lastly, since it was a palace the space is absolutely huge. It took us at least a good two hours, maybe more, to walk across and get a glimpse of each room. There are also small rooms of pottery and weaponry that serve as mini museums along the way, and so it feels a bit like going through the Louvre when we're walking through. There's a lot to see but only so much time. Since we often travel wanting to see everything, we accept the fact that maybe in China, since the sites are so expansive, it's difficult to do so. The size of the place adds to its depth when you walk through. It's essentially like a historical park, given its wide coverage of many acres of land. So, we slowly make our way , seeing how the Emperor lived, how the concubines lived, and how the elite lived; where ceremonies were held, where things were sacrificed. The feeling is profound as you step into each of the different courts. There have been a few parts refurbished but it doesn't detract from the ambience. Placards are placed all around detailing the founding of the Qing Dynasty by Nurhaci, and glorifying him for finding one of the last dynasties in China. Of course then, an Imperial Palace that served to represent the Qing Dynasty must be this great. Take a look at the pictures:&nbsp;</p>

      <p>After seeing the Palace, we needed lunch. The street stretching out of the Palace is an old street that has recently been refurbished. It was supposed to be the street that led from one of the main pagoda gates to the Imperial Palace. But, it has recently been modified and as such, there are a couple of tourist shops littered across, with expensive restuaranta also lined in it. To avoid paying an arm and a leg for some decent Chinese food, we duck out into a small side road and tuck into a random corner shop selling spicy noodles. On the signboard, it says 四川辣麵 - Sichuan Spicy Noodles. Sounds good for this weather.</p>
      <p>The restaurant only has about 8 chairs, and is long and rectangular. At the end of the building, there is an older lady and man who takes orders and prepares the food. The menu, like many menus in China, are all on the wall, with a picture shown and no English. We order and have a seat, while the lady prepares the food with her husband in the back. As we sit and wait for our noodles, two guys from the North also walk in and order in a hefty voice their dishes. They shout across the restaurant (which is already quite small) to the old man and woman, and they nod and take the order. They sound aggressive, but it's actually just the local regional accent projection. When they sit down and talk to each other, their accent is still very thick but it noticeably quiets down. We happily sip our noodles and let the spicyness warm up our bodies.</p>
      <p>By the time we finish, we walk back down this more tourist road in search of Zhang's Mansion. It has come up a couple of times in the tourist books but, if I'm being honest, I had no idea who this Zhang guy actually was and why he had a mansion. When we walk back, we pass by the Imperial Palace, except this time we pass by a mini urban park along the way. It's similar to just a pavement with people walking around and cars occasionally driving by; a small pedestrianized place. There are uncles and aunties sitting and chatting, and there are a couple of them flying kites as well, passing the time. A man is sat there with what looks like a captain's wheel and he's reeling in fiercely, trying to gain control of his kite just floating gently in the still, Shenyang air.&nbsp;</p>
      <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center">
        <div><img src="images/shenyang_5.JPG">
        </div>
      </figure>

      <p>Kids are running around the park area and parents are sitting down watching them play. The kids all look the same: in Dong Bei, they are just a walking bundle of jackets and scarves, and they happily bounce around in their layers of clothes as they follow their parents. Some of them are so wrapped up that only a small section of their eyes are visible, as if in a pseudo burqa. It's a peaceful walk to the mansion through this pedestrianized area. I like how in the midst of the old temple and the modern city, there is this quiet space for people to stroll; an activity most loved by the Chinese.</p>
      <p>We finally make it to the mansion. There is a statue of Zhang at the front (we still don't know who he is), and we see that the entry fee to get in actually 30 RMB. There are a bunch of old uncles standing outside, gathered around and waiting around for seemingly something, but I'm not quite sure what. Still, their presence makes for some good pictures. Now, normally we'd be OK to pay that price but every place in Northern China thus far has required us to pay somewhere between 30 to 60 to get in to the site. It's normally an OK fare to pay, but it's still quite steep, especially considering we have to pay this fare for every single site. So, we decide to skip this one and just head onto the Buddhist temple and the church, because surely the religious wouldn't charge for their institutions. That is, unless you're St. Paul's.&nbsp;</p>

      </figure>

      <p>To get there we walk down one of the very many big streets in Shenyang. There are apartment buildings, with many small businesses built below that range from restaurants, hair dressers, food shops, trading companies, etc. Everything that you can find is in these small shops, and you sometimes wonder how these places even do business in a big city like Shenyang when there are so many places doing the same thing. As we walk, there are many more that just line the streets. I also wonder if all the apartments are filled up, too. The competition must be so fierce. The existence here must be so anonymous. So we keep walking and passing us is the development of modern China. As we near the Buddhist 慈恩 - Ci En - Temple, it starts becoming a lot quieter. Then, we find ourselves in the monastery.&nbsp;</p>
      <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center">

        </div>
      </figure>
      <p>The monastery is quiet, except there are Buddhist monks that are huddled inside and doing some chants. They are moving in a counterclockwise direction, women and men alike, and they are slowly shuffling along the ground. They take a step, chant a bit, and then continue to walk around. We have no idea what they're actually doing so we just continue to walk around the monastery grounds.</p>
      <p>There's something about a monastery in winter that gives it a completely different vibe than what we're used to. Usually, we see monasteries during the heat of Southeast Asia, and so many times going in, it becomes a place that's shady and a place of rest away from the bustle of the city surrounding it. It's different in the winter. When I am here in the winter, there's a tranquility to the monastery that I don't find when I go in the summer. Everything is quiet outside since everyone is ducked inside to escape the cold. The lawns are lined lightly with snow and there's a silence that is simultaneously haunting and peaceful. The architecture almost looks slightly different as well, with the brick layered roof and the sharply sloping roof, and the grayish bricks that are built to withhold the winter heat. The incense burning almost has a clearer smell to it since the staleness of the air around it allows the fragrance to diffuse easily. It's a much deeper, different experience than what I'm used to in Southeast Asia. When we walk a little bit further we come across the actual temple, which also has a similar ambience to the monastery. The snow blankets the place and gives it a place of spiritual importance, an air of enlightenment. I feel at peace here.&nbsp;</p>

        </div>
      </figure>
      <p>When we step out, the honking of the horns and the noise of the city picks up again. There are a few beggars outside the temple looking for some money, a difficult task to be doing especially in the weather. We walk past them like the sinners we are and then decide to go to check out the Catholic church that is down the street. I only realized when I typed this that that was super, super entitled and privileged. Ignoring beggars, and then going to 'pretend to be holy' by seeing a church. Ha ha.</p>
      <p>We walk back again up the street we came down, and the shops are all still there. We pass by a street actually called 熱鬧 street, which actually means "loud and exciting", which definitely it is. A couple of turns here and there, and we make it to the Catholic church. It's a pretty sight, but it's almost so out of place being in a Chinese city. It's a weird thing, imperialism, since there's an international import of culture, creating a kind of juxtaposition of things that don't belong. Inside, there is a nativity scene still up from the Christmas celebration they had before (Jesus must have been fucking freezing). Ironically, there is a Christmas tree with a Santa Claus - a more commericial Christmas character - just directly across from it. Inside also is a lady and a man taking their wedding photos. The lady is in her wedding dress and the man is in his wedding suit. To prevent from freezing in the below zero weather, the bride is wearing a wonderfully beautiful orange and red jacket that is a little ostentatious. It's so over the top glamorous that you can't help but look. There is a man holding her train, a man fixing her veil, and the photographer trying to get the perfect shot. As everyone lines up in their place, a woman takes off the jacket and the bride is fully in her wedding dress, back and arms bare, trying to get the perfect shot. If she wasn't also like that baby Jesus in a manger, freezing her ass off, she must have been Jesus reincarnate her/himself, impervious to any kind of averse weather conditions. She wore a cakeful of makeup, but she was smiling through it all.</p>
      <p>The image of the church in the wintertime, to me, is like the temple in Southeast Asia. It's what I'm used to seeing. When I see churches in Southeast Asia then I also get a different vibe, the same when I went to the Buddhist temple in the winter here in Shenyang. Something about the coldness and the snow fit the image of the church, and my idea of what "church" should be. But, it's interesting to see that in other parts of the world, people still worship in their own way, in their own weather, and that's their conceptualization of their religion.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Seeing as today was just a religious site hopping, our next stop was the Taoist temple. We loosely follow my over-the-great-Chinese-firewall 2G international data plan access to Google Maps, going along the big, busy roads of Shenyang. Along the way, we come across a small road of streetside vendors that are selling various things, from traditional Chinese snacks to fresh meat. This is the first time we've seen an actual street market out here in the North. Everyone is wrapped up in thick jackets but they've prepared all their products facing the street to try to make a sale. There are some fresh winter fruit stands selling pears and apples, and nearby, a fish stall selling the catch of the day. We think to ourselves that this weather must be pretty good for selling meat since it wouldn't spoil with the cold air. We continue walking down the street, and it's a weird hodgepodge of Mercedes Benzes, rickshaw bicycles, e-bikes, and pedestrian traffic scooting around between the vendors. There is a small taste of Old China on this street; what I imagine was more prevalent in many Chinese cities before development: the open-air markets, the true market-style selling of goods, all probably locally fresh and harvested. It's also strangely out of place among the high rise apartment buildings that have come up around them, but they have found a small street that seems badly paved to continue the trade. But, there's such a strong generational component to the flourish of these spaces. I think that with the new generation of Modern China, there won't be a willingness to continue these open markets, at least not in an organic way. There'll probably be a hipster revival in the near future, as there has been some hipster revivals and spots in Beijing, but nothing as authentic as a market that has sprung up out of necessity; out of human survival. I don't realize it at the time, but I think every market like this I pass in China will soon also be engulfed by Development. But, that's the direction of progress. I think I'm probably far more sentimental (and pessimistic) about holding on to Chinese culture than the Chinese are. It's just a market, after all.&nbsp;</p>

      </figure>
      <p>When we get to the Taoist temple we find that it's closed, so we decide to head back to the hostel for the day. The sun sets here at about 16:30 and so it gets colder during the night. Everyone seems to tuck away indoors, and we do the same. Around our hostel there are a couple of food shops that sell the usual Northern Chinese staples: dumplings, pickled vegetables, etc. We tuck into one to get a 1 Singapore Dollar (about 75 US Cents) bowl of noodles, probably one of the cheapest meals we've found while here. When we go in, the lady has a thick accent that does not sound like she's from the north. I don't make anything of it, again, in the same way that they don't make anything of my Chinese even though it sounds nothing like the local accent. We enjoy our bowl of beef noodles, which is mostly just starch and three thin slices of meat (of course, we didn't expect a posh bowl of beef noodles given the price), and another couple walks in to order takeout. The guy talks in a thick accent, but does not sound quite like the lady owning the stall, and does not sound northern. The guy takes a guess at the owner's accent, "Hey, do you come from Anhui Province?" And the lady nods. She smiles and acknowledges the man, and then continues talking in her (now identified) Anhui accent to her colleague. Again, the mobility of the Chinese within their country, and how you see a more subtle, provincial-level diversity.</p>
