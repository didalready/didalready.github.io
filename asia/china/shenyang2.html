      <p>‍</p>
      <p>Shenyang is the birthplace of the Qing Dynasty. It's pretty strange, seeing as Shenyang is now a modern city, but there are still cultural relics scattered around it. The modern city has risen to overtake them and now the relics are anachronistic; displaced with time. But, once you step in, the depth of history is preserved.</p>
      <p>Shenyang is also the location for various tombs of the first few emperors of the Qing prior to the moving of the capital to Beijing. When the Manchus took over back in the 1600s, they started from here and made their way slowly down towards Beijing. So, today we went to go visit the tomb of the Second Emperor, just based on proximity. There is another Eastern Tomb that we went to, but that was later.</p>
      <p>We get off of the railway station and are hit with the chill in the air. But, today is a sunny day and we continue walking. We're unsure as to where the entrance is so we walk along a small pedestrian path with a wall lining to the right. We think that the palace is somewhere in there, but we're still looking for the entrance. We eventually walk all the way out to the main road and decide to head back, as we realize the entrance is actually in the opposite direction.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>One thing about Chinese architecture is the size. When we finally find the entrance and purchase our tickets, there are two tickets: one to enter the park, and one to enter the tomb. Confused to what this means, the lady explains it to us. The actual site of the tomb occupies a small area, but the leadup to the actual tomb is a park. Because there is so much Chinese land, these sites occupy an immense amount of area. The walk from the entrance to the tomb structures is about 1 km, through this park. And, throughout the park, there are activities going on on the side.</p>
      <p>While we slowly make our way down this kilometer long path, serenity hovers in the air. Many old folks are walking around and sitting, enjoying the fresh air and the good weather. There are also families that are slowly walking to the front of the park to go visit the tomb. As we get closer, we see a patch of ice and people doing 'chair skiing,' which is essentially people sitting on metal chairs placed on the ice, and using two small ski poles to push themselves across the ice. It's the cutest thing, watching the kids trying to push themselves across the ice, and also the adults joining along. There's something about strolling through this park that's peaceful, I'm not sure if it's the weather, the location of the site, or the people.&nbsp;</p>

      </figure>
      <p>As we get closer, we see a large ice rink that must have been a lake frozen over. On it, there was a ring of ice with piles of snow delineating the ring. It was an outdoor skating rink, and there were some people practicing speedskating on it, as well as some people trying their hand at hockey. On a smaller rink closer to the entrance of the tomb which we were standing, there was a man who was a bit shaky, learning how to ice skate. He must have been 50, but he seemed to be enjoying himself, unphased by the chilly weather.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>From the tombs that I've seen, they mostly are in a small building or in a small area, and maybe a memorial plaque or a museum is set up in its place. In these Chinese tombs, they also occupy tremendous space. They are built similarly to the 'four courtyard' houses, and as you pass through one pagoda, you enter another courtyard, with a total of about three different courtyards, constituting the entire tomb site. For those that have been to the Forbidden Palace in Beijing, you would understand what I mean. Just the amount of space that these Chinese memorials occupy is massive, almost as if indirectly showing you the power of China and Her strength. There's such a seriousness in the air that is almost reflective of the Chinese people in how they practice rites and rituals. It's the hundreds of years of history memorialized in one place, and how all of that history is condensed into the atmosphere, and I love it. I love how immense it is. I love how you walk for about 30 minutes to actually reach the front of the tomb structure. I love how serious it all is, all to memorialize a leader of one of the most famous dynasties in China. So we take our step into the tomb and embrace it.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Once you get inside, you can spend another hour at a slow pace just to walk around the entire tomb grounds. There are some old building structures still standing, and most of them have been decorated in the interior to recreate the look of the Qing dynasty. Another thing we notice is that it's mostly all outdoors, except for these few buildings that have been converted to little museums. There are also some castle walls that span around the perimeter of the enclosement, and so we take our time to walk around that as well. While we walk around, we get a great view of the entire layout of the courtyard, and the snow that has fallen on the rooves gives it a certain historical charm to it. I imagine it would be a totally different experience in the summer. There's actually not much to see except the tomb itself, as well as some of the large stones with Mongolian, Manchu, and Chinese characters carved into it as a memorial. It's actually quite incredible, instead of having a plaque printed out, these people carved out this massive memorial out of stone and set it right in the middle as you pass from the first to the second courtyard. Again, a testament to the greatness of Chinese architecture, and how they took their memorials so seriously. But, otherwise, most of the interesting part I would say is the actual atmosphere of the area. Just to be able to stand there and feel the history is something worth going for.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>We usually do our sightseeing quite quickly, but what ends up happening in China, especially in the winter, is that the days are a lot shorter, and the sites are a lot bigger. In addition, since most of the historical things in China have been built long ago, they may not be necessarily all be clustered around the same area. So, we decide to head back and take a rest for the day. The cold weather makes us quite sleepy.</p>
      <p>---</p>
      <p>At night, we get a recommendation from the staff to check out 西塔, Xita, area. It's actually one long street, but what's so cool about it is that it's a Korean street. Like I said, Shenyang actually is close to the Korean border (alright, North Korea, but you get the idea) and is home to many ethnic Koreans. When you ask the Chinese about them, they respond in an interesting way. They'll assert first that they are Chinese, but they happen to be of Korean descent. So, in a way they consider them just as a Korean ethnic minority in China. I suppose you could draw similar connections to being Asian American, except for maybe the fact that most Americans will not think an Asian American person is, in fact, American. So, there's a centrality to Chinese nationality. Yes, they may happen to be ethnically Korean, but they are still Chinese, well, to the Chinese at least.</p>
      <p>We decide to take the metro there, and there's a bit of walking from the station. On the way there, we pass by the People's Monument whereby a huge (again, referring to how the Chinese do their memorials seriously) statue of -- you guessed it -- Mao is erected in the middle. He's doing his classic pose, with the one, right hand salute off to the distance. Below him, there are many common people also cheering and surging forward in the same direction as his hand. It's the most serious thing but also simultaneously the most amazing thing. It's a random street, and here in the center of the roundabout is this huge statue of Mao. His presence in the cold winter is daunting, and seems to overshadow and overlook the pedestrians walking by in a sort of big-brotherish way. That's China for you, on a random street, you find a huge statue of Mao in the middle of a roundabout. Just in case you forgot who the founder of Modern China was..&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Xita is almost like a miniature version of those old school Asian streets with bright neon lights hanging from the buildings, and a lot of traffic going through the middle. It's almost like a mini Downtown Taipei, or probably like some small streets that you see in Japan with food stalls littered throughout the way. There's a certain dystopian novelesque feel to the street when I photograph it. There's a sprawl to the street that is alive, and makes you want to party. The signs are all in Korean and Chinese, and there are a few KTV bars also scattered throughout, the kind where you have a good time with some of the karaoke girls. It's a nice area, and it's relatively young too so many people are walking around and ducking into restaurants and bars to go party with their friends for the night. Thorin and I decide to just go for a meal, and tuck into a small street. We see a restaurant that is pretty poppin' and so we go inside.&nbsp;</p>
      <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center">

      <p>It's a wonderful little restaurant, with all of the seating on the floor. We wait 5 minutes for our seat and plop ourselves down on the floor. Everyone stares a bit since they see a white person eating, and an Asian man with a white person, but they continue going on eating. We order some delicious stewed beef as well as some rice, and it comes with small side dishes as is often in Korean cuisine. It's probably one of my favorite meals in the entire trip.&nbsp;</p>

      </figure>
      <p>While we are eating and drinking, there is a table of Chinese-Koreans to the right of us. It's the coolest thing to watch them converse amongst themselves in Korean, and then when the waiters and waitresses come, they order in a fluent Chinese. In Dandong, the bordering town with North Korea, you expect to see this a bit more as it's closer, but it's great to see this small ethnic enclave in China. For my whole life, I thought it was just one big country full of Chinese people. To some degree, it is, as they're tied togehter by nationality. But the reality of it is the Chinese people are just as diverse as people everywhere else are. This is a rather obvious statement, but we don't take the time to consider what's going on in these cities with ethnic enclaves, in seeing how a minority group molds itslef into the dominant culture. People, not just the Chinese, are unique in their own way. Here, there's a bunch of Chinese Koreans. But, I've never met any one like that in the U.S. Everyone has a story. And so, as Thorin and I eat in XiTa street we observe this weird cross mixture of cultures. It's not the Asian Americans, Latino Americans that we're used to seeing, but rather it's a dual minority cross culture, Chinese and Korean. Watching them code switch between languages is the coolest thing, and inspires me to continue learning my Chinese. Plus, you put Koreans and Chinese into a bloodline, they're bound to love to drink. The waiter keeps bringing in bottles of beer and soju for the table next to us, as the other guests finish, and the next party replaces them. We are sat in the middle watching it all happen, and we also wash down our meal with some soju and beer.&nbsp;</p>
