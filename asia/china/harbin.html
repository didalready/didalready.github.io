      <p>‍</p>
      <p>The train rolls into Harbin, our most northern stop for the trip. Everyone along the way in Dalian and Shenyang have been warning us about the weather and how cold it 'actually is' in Northern China. Thorin and I put on our jackets. We haven't bought anymore additional clothing except for the thick jackets at the Dalian market. And, we step out on the platform. "Not so bad."</p>
      <p>We spend the next 10 minutes looking for the MRT. It turns into one of those situations where we follow the arrow and keep following it until we realized the station actually hasn't been built yet. Even better, we were encircling the construction that was fenced off, but covered with a poster of the "would be" MRT station. So, instead we have to go outside with the taxi touts and find our way to the city center. A flood of people ask us where we are going and we say to the center. We ask them to turn on the meter, unsure as to whether or not our taxi is kosher. Turns out, it was kosher, but the guy's meter seemed to be running at a rate twice as fast as normal meters go! We spend the first few minutes worrying but then realize we're too embarrassed to tell the driver to just drop us off and we hail another cab, so we sit and suffer through the whole way. However, if there's any redeeming quality, the guy was very nice, and trying to make an extra few bucks along the way. He told us of some must-trys in Harbin as well as some sites to go look for -- ones that were more off the beaten path. As he happily spoke and we worried, he kept suggesting places, and even offered us his business card to hire him to take us around for the next few days, "if we wanted to."</p>
      <p>He drops us off about 1 block from our hostel. We do our normal checkin and put our bags down in our room. We're still a bit rough from the New Years Eve party the night before, but we're doing alright, so we head out. This time, we felt it. That harsh Harbin weather striking our faces that'd just emerged from the warmth of the hostel. There's a bitterness to it that will rip the skin off your face, but also a crispness to it that makes each breath refreshing. As we made our way to 中央大街, Zhong Yang main street, the main shopping street, we had begun to feel the cold settle on our face, as if it were some tangible small dew crystallizing on our pores.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Although it's cold outside, there's enough to distract you on Zhong Yang Street. It's essentially the high street - think Oxford Circus, Orchard Street, Santana Row (for all my Bay Area folks) - in the city. Strung along are designer shops selling faux French high fashion merchandise that you know is fake, but still buy because it doesn't look half bad. There are shop touters who are standing outside yelling their deals for the season, but even they tuck inside occasionally to escape the cold. Despite the freezing weather outside and the chill, everyone is still going about the street, wandering around from shop to shop looking at what the stores have to sell.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Zhong Yang street is also known for some pretty famous foods, such as their smoked sausage and 'vanilla ice stick' (which is kind of like a popsicle, but the consistency is a little bit more solid and feels like you're biting into a sorbet). Along the street, if you see a queue of people waiting for something, it's likely to be one of these two items. There's no shortage of food on the street, just in true Chinese fashion. Another famous sweet snack is 冰糖葫蘆, bing tang hulu, which is translated as 'candied gourd on a stick.' You can imagine it being a very small crab apple that is frozen, but dipped in a coating of melted sugar, and then left to dry so there is a coat on it. Having them wait in the cold air also gives it a slight frozen tinge to it, but not to the point where it makes your teeth sensitive. They've extended this out to include many fruits, such as dragonfruit, kiwis, and strawberries as well, so you can buy a combo stick that has all of these fruits skewered toether then dipped in the melted sugar. It's a wonderful snack -- or, a meal, really, considering there are about 10 of them strung onto one skewer. A different take on the 5-a-day recommendation.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>If anyone knows Harbin for anything, it will be for their ice sculptures. For about 6 months of the year the city is in subzero conditions, and the winters can get harsh (as we were experiencing, although it had not even snowed). So, what better to do in a cold city than to carve ice. And, what better way to display it than on the main shopping street. All throughout Zhong Yang street, there are random carvings of ice throughout the main road, and the many small roads that branch off from it. Some of them will look more like melted ice (as in, they have a thin coating of water on it and are opaque), and some will be more similar to packed snow, and a deeper white in color, impenetrable by light. Some of the sculptures are very small, and some of them are large enough to even have a small platform or sitting bench to walk/sit on. I love watching the children play on these things, there's an innocence and simple appreciation among their actions. Like all children in the winter, they are a ball of sweaters and jackets, and they just love the ice stuff. You'll see them walking up and down on the sculptures, fearless about the possibility of falling. Then, you'll see them lying on the sculptures and encouraging their parents to take a picture of them while they pose. Other adults are also playing on the sculptures but not in the carefree way that children do it.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Sculptures not only came in different shapes and sizes, symbolizing things like New Years (with a rooster, to celebrate the upcoming lunar year) or 'love' (you can bet that there was going to be a heart-shaped glass where couples were taking pictures around), but, the sculptures also came with different messages. Many sculptures were actually advertisements for the companies - anywhere from Coca Cola and their big snow ice bear, to the local bottled water company. Even Harbin beer had their own huge beer bootle, made out of ice, strung nicely with lights and proudly advertising their drink. Just in case we'd forgotten that Zhong Yang was a place of business, these ice-ads reminded us kindly. The best part though, was that the Chinese seemed to be unphased by this. If there was somewhere to play on, or touch the ice, they would do it. It's as if suburban American kids from the midwest went to play around a billboard.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The stretch of the street extends about 1 mile or so, and all throughout the street you see so many people. People from all over China, mostly. People going into shops, eating sausages and popsicles, and sometimes just standing for a good ol' selfie. Everyone is infatuated with the ice sculptures, often which have small colorful lights placed in them to give some luminescence. As the light scatters off the ice, it produces a very nice effect. There are perpendicular streets bisecting the pedestrianized road allowing for auto traffic, but it's well regulated. We keep walking all the way towards the 鬆花江, Songhua River, which is the main river that borders the city at the northern end of the pedestrian street. When we get there, we see people lighting off sparklers nearby the "Flood Control Monument" commemorating the lives lost by a few people during a flood back in the 50s. A policeman goes up to them and says that sparklers are not allowed in this premise, and they have nothing to do but to watch it burn out; their spirits crushed. The police then finds out that there are a few vendors selling the sparklers, and in a quick, heated exchange the policeman says, "I already told you to stop selling them, and you're not. So, I'm taking them away." As the auntie pleads for them back in a demanding tone, the policeman ignores her and continues to walk away. He turns around one more time to tell her that she was disobedient and, since she kept selling and didn't listen, they have to be confiscated. And so they were. The other vendors, seeing this as an example, quickly packed up their shops and left. But, the people who had bought them kept lighting them.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The Flood Monument is just a large, concrete pillar in the center of a half dome with some people standing atop it. It anchors the end of Zhong Yang street nicely, punctuating the end of the street and commemorating those it's meant to commemorate. Just past it is the Songhua River, which is at a lower elevation than the monument. And so, we pass the Monument and ascend upon the small 'hill' vantage point looking down at the Songhua. I stand there for a moment to appreciate what I see.</p>
      <p>The Songhua has frozen over for the winter season. There are hundreds of people standing on it, doing various activities. I see a small car driving across the ice and pulling a 'float boat' of about 8 people and they are being spun on the ice. Not too far away, people are lighting up the sparklers - the same kind that were confiscated earlier, except this time there are no policemen patroling the area. I also see people lighting lanterns with blessings written on it, similar to the kind that are released in the Taipei town near the railroad tracks. I see all kinds of people from different walks across China, accents from the North, and accents from the south. They're gathered here on this frozen river, a solid block of ice, only illuminated by battery generated lights that seem to blare and reflect off the ice, which is no longer pristine and white given the humin traffic. The smoke from the sparklers shrouds the river with a light fog, and when the lights shine through it also has a misting effect. Strewn on the ground are all the sparklers that have fused out and are no longer in use - a direct contrast to the continued, burning spirit of people celebrating on the River.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>I've said it again and I'll say it again. I love this place in the winter. The weather conditions are cold and harsh, but there's a joy in the tourism that keeps the place alive: the people celebrating on the river, the massive amounts of tourists walking down the main street. In the winter, it's romantic. A great place to just walk and watch people, as it is with most places in China. As the New Years Eve party catches up with Thorin, we decide to head back to the hostel, but not before I get one of the famous sausages. The smell nearly makes Thorin vom. On the way back, he finally throws it up within a small ring where a tree is planted. Little did we know that the ring wasn't actually enclosed, just sloping off so as to have a draining point onto the sidewalk. Trickling, the vomit begins to follow a small, streamlined path across the sidewalk into the street. Passerbys don't even pass judgment, they just keep walking. It'll be frozen in the morning. Happy New Year.</p>
