      <p>‍</p>
      <p>When we get up we first think about breakfast. After all the bureaucracy of opening the bank account and getting the SIM card the day before, today was our day to actually be the usual tourists of Dalian.</p>
      <p>In the end of my last post, I mentioned the "regionality" of China. In a country that is a population billionaire, much of the diversity is internal and not international unless in a Tier 1 city like Beijing, Shanghai, or Shenzhen. Long gone are the days where everyone was born in one place, and lived in one place, then died in that same place. In the smaller tier, but still big cities in China, what you see is domestic diversity. It's not about what country you're from, but rather what province you are from in China. Chances are, if you're from a province that is not the province in which you are staying, you have some interesting story of how you got there. The population of China is such in transition that this is the modern day reality. If one hears someone speaking dialect, a common question that one would ask is where they are from. That, or they take a shot as to what accent they have to place them.</p>
      <p>In places like the U.S. and the U.K., there is an expectation to assimilate to the local culture. In China, when the Han culture is pretty much similar but diversity is more 'subtle' such as with language and accent, I do not konw if there's the same pressure to assimilate. Usually, shop owners can converse together in their local dialect and so they retain some of their own provincial culture, and are not washed out by the 'dominant' provincial culture from which they stay. When we eat breakfast that morning, we walk into a Shanxi (different from Shaanxi province) noodle shop, as advertised by their signboard. Through the ordering process, I'm able to distinguish that their accent isn't quite as Dong Bei as I've been used to hearing for the past 2 or so days. But, I don't really make anything of it and just am happy to be eating more Chinese food in the morning.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>When another guest comes in on her own, she orders a bowl of noodles, cleraly in a thick Dong Bei accent. She's a happy person, quite smiley and she slurps away at her noodles. When Thorin and I converse in English, she glances over occasionally at us and smiles as well. As she's leaving, she hears the two ladies who work at the store talking to each other in their local dialect. She asks them, "Are you guys speaking in Shanxi dialect?" with a smile. The two ladies smile and say, "Yes, we're from there!" The Dong Bei lady says, "Yeah I heard you two talking a language and didn't understand, but I thought it was Shanxi!" She finishes and she pays, then leaves.</p>
      <p>The conversation was short, no longer than 10 seconds. But in those 10 seconds, I've learned a lot about the intricacies of what it means to be "Chinese." How the concept of nationality trumps any kind of regional variation, but how people still retain their home culture and are proud of it. They speak their local dialect at home, and they cook the food from their region. They're even generous enough to open a restaurant and give us a taste of their home province. Usually, the government is pretty good about letting local provincial culture flourish, granted it does not come at the expense of Chinese nationality. This means, you still have to learn 普通話, or Standard Mandarin Chinese, but everyone ends up speaking local dialect anyway. This is somewhat like the Singaporean model, without the active repression of local dialect culture. However, this is not always the case. This is why we see a difference with the Uighurs, because their local culture and language is actively suppressed by the Chinese government. And so by nationality they are Chinese, and they do speak standard Mandarin, but in fact, they refuse to accept often that they are Chinese by nationality because their local culture and language is actually anything but Chinese.</p>
      <p>Anyway, this is just an interesting little tidbit. Today is shopping day. Our old jackets are not cutting it. It's freezing here, so we decide to go check out the Dalian Train Station and then the Dalian central market that sells jackets at wholesale. Before we get to the market, we pass the absolutely massive train station that is planted in the front. The style is distinctly Chinese, as I've already mentioned many times before. Large and rectangular, built in some kind of brownish marble color. There aren't many intricacies to the building, it's just a really big space. On the top of the station, as it is with every station in China, there is the name of the station: "DA LIAN" - 大連. Other than that, there isn't anything very glamorous about the building, but its size is something to marvel at.&nbsp;</p>

      </figure>
      <p>It takes us a while to figure out how to actually circumnavigate this goliath and hit up the market. When we finally figure it out, it takes another 10 minutes to walk from the station portion to the actual market. The market is also similarly built, but with more disorder it. On the outside there are a bunch of advertising signs for various clothing items , and then we make our way in.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Much like the underground Dalian malls, this mall is a collection of independent sellers that are bumming off things from coats, jackets, socks, everything, you name it. We make a round and try on jackets and ask for the price to shop around. Since all the prices are haggle-able here we want to get the best bargain for coat quality. There's a certain art to it that takes a while to master, and a certain shamelessness when it comes to listing your price. In the West, for some reason we're taught to accept the price as is and it would be rude otherwise to bargain, maybe suggesting that the buyer is a cheapo if they were to. But, in China, it's almost expected and if you don't then you're getting ripped off up front. There's no aggression to the process, though, it's a friendly little banter that always happens in order to get the clothes you want. After about 1 hour of walking around and bargaining for jackets, we finally settle on some and make our purchase, happy with it. After an hour, we had only made one round of the floor we were on, and this market had many more floors. We made our way up to the 5th floor and spent around 30 minutes trying to find a pair of boots for us to buy. Thorin's boot seller compliments his Chinese and says that people from England make a good effort to try to learn the local language. He then proceeds to diss Russians and say how they never bother to integrate and just speak in their language very loudly, without any manners. As he's telling this story, he's trying to make the sale to Thorin by telling him how good the quality is of his boots, and how they're made from camel skin. I get these Chelsea-ish boots from a lady that seems nonfussed and unwilling to bargain with me at the point. Now that we both bought shoes that'll keep our feet warm for the weather ahead as we move up north, we decide to head out. After about 1.5 hours in the place, we get absolutely exhausted and walk out into the cold. This time, we're kept warm, and we feel proud of our accomplishments of the haggling process - quite an experience in China. You could probably spend a whole day shopping for outfits in the mall.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>From the market, we make our way down to the old Russian Street that was established back when the Russians had some influence in Dalian. It's just one street, and there's not much going on since most of the vendors have tucked inside to hide from the weather. Most of the shops are closed and boarded up with the metallic lining that often lines shops when they're closed. The street is rather barren, but there are old Russian style houses that line the street, and they make for a few good pictures. All of the signs are in Chinese characters and Cyrillic, with the occasional English. Our mastery of Cyrillic was put to the test as we tried to read the old signs. As we head to the end of the street, there is a very old Russian building that has fallen into disrepair and has scaffolding surrounding it. To the left, a few men in blue camouflage outfits are practicing a march, and they march from nearby the old dilapidated building back down the road from which they came. They're marching in perfect unison, one step after the other, and not one is in misstep. They look over at Thorin and me since he's a foreigner and I'm the "Chinese looking guy with a foreigner", but their step does not break in the process. They continue to march and then disappear.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Based on other reviews of the street, it seems this place is rather touristy, but I'm glad we caught it while we did. We ducked into a small coffee shop with a lady that had a string of photos from various visitors -- mostly Western -- that have stopped into her coffee shop. I think she actually lived in the house on the street, but had turned it into the cafe. When we walk in, she asks us for what we want, and she happily decides to make our coffee. Thorin orders the double espresso, me the cappucino. There is a young guy also in the corner of the shop who is on his laptop. The coffee is served, and the lady begins chatting to Thorin and me. She talks about the business lately of the shop, and how there aren't many people that come in the wintertime so business is slow. We want ot know if there's still a lot of Russians that frequent the street, and she says not anymore, especially as most of the Russian economy hasn't been doing too well for tourism (and, even at that, if they had money then they would go somewhere that's warm, and not Dong Bei). She says you can often see some Russian beggars now on the street in Dalian, but we couldn't verify this for ourselves. As she gets chatting, we discuss all the mundane topics of life. What we do for jobs, what is Singapore like, how old we look, and if the salary is good in Singapore. These are pretty standard questions in a Chinese conversation, and we chat openly about it to her. While we talk, another troupe of soldiers walks by in unison and march off in the direction where we entered the Russian street. The kid in the corner with the laptop, turns out, was doing some accountancy work for the lady and so he was also chatting along. In Chinese, we would call these "Common Hundred People" people who 聊得來 - people that converse quite easily and naturally. Overall, a very friendly interaction as I think she is interested in meeting people from abroad, based on the photo series on the wall. We thanked her for the two cups of coffee - both really good - and then were on our way. Before we leave, we of course get her recommendations for some local food. She hopes we will meet again.</p>
      <p>The last part of our attire that we needed was a hat, and it just so happened that a lady was selling hats on this Russian street. It was a sort of cap with ear flaps down and looked pretty good, so we asked the lady how much. She quoted a price of 225 RMB - the local currency - with comes out to about 45 SGD, or maybe 35 USD. Way too pricy. So we just jog on, but the ladies keep pressing further trying to make a sale. They pull us into the shop to try it on since there is a mirror, and Thorin looks really good in the hat. They say the ultimate price that they'll go for is 200, which is too much, and we tell them that and prepare to leave. Finally, the lady says, "OK, name your price then." Thorin lowballs a 100 RMB - 20 SGD - 14 USD. They're shocked at the lowball but also know that it's money at the end of the day. She goes on to say that the "quality is very good, though" and proceeds to light the top of the hat on fire with a lighter. "See, it can even protect against fire and it doesn't burn easily." In the back of Thorin's head, he's wondering when he'll have to be burned on his head, but he takes it as a sign that the quality of the hat is pretty decent. He sticks to his guns at 100, and gets the price he wants. Not bad for a hat made out of leather that does not burn under fire. They even convince me to get one too since it looks so good, so I guess in the end they end up profiting. They throw in an extra bar of Russian Chocolate just for buying the other hat, and we taste it. It's alright. Not too much flavor. They also try to sell to Thorin some razor, as well as Russian Nesting Dolls, etc, but he just politely refuses. It's funny to see them trying so hard to make a sale, but I have to say, they're persistent.</p>
      <p>For lunch, we go to a restaurant that serves Dong Bei food, and we order a "殺豬湯" - which is a killed pork soup. It comes in a pot and there is pork blood, pork intestines, and pork innards in the soup, all placed nicely over some 酸菜, pickled vegetables, that gets stewed into some deliciousness. We also order a tofu and vegetable dish. The portions here are visibly larger and almost American by standards, since it's so cold and larger portions fill you up for longer parts of the day. We have trouble making it through all of the food and just leave some leftovers, but it was probably some of the best food we've had here. Very warming for the day, and also very fresh flavors. While we eat, two men are sitting across from us and they've already made it through a couple of bottles of beer each, and are clearly drunk. They continue to finish up and drink, and as they get up to leave they greet Thorin with a hearty Dong Bei "Hello! Welcome to China!" in English, and they smile. Thorin smiles back and also says a small Ni Hao to them. They're rough but nice, and they stumble out of the restaurant as they make their way. We just take in the experience: to be able to see a couple of guys drunk on a Tuesday during lunchtime.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>We get back to the hostel and decide to take the train to Shenyang, our next stop. We hail a taxi off to the Northern Rail Station and book our tickets for Shenyang. As we drive through, we pass by many more apartment buildings, stacked very high and clustered closely together. Although the size is impressive it still never ceases to amaze me how tall the buildings can get here, and how, standing at the base (or, driving by the base) looking up you're looking at something that was probably built in months. They just tower over the people below, and it's absolutely fascinating to see. It's like you're actually in a big city, and Dalian is one of the smaller ones in the country. When we get to the train station, it's perfectly sunset time. I peer out into the horizon and it's just more apartment buildings in the horizon. The sun sets behind them and illuminates a silhouette that is comprised of hundreds of bulidings that tower above the highways, only smaller than the mountains that are behind them. The station is built similarly to Dalian main station, except this time it has the characters "Da Lian Bei" - Dalian North - station stacked on top of it, propped up by metal pole scaffolding. We duck in and buy our rail tickets to Shenyang.</p>
      <p>Inside the station, there isn't a maze of walls or partitions, but rather it's just what it would appear to be from the outside, a large empty space in the middle.&nbsp;</p>
      <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center">

      </figure>
      <p>All the stations leave from the bottom floor, and there are just chairs placed all over the station. There are a few luxury brand shops propped up in the middle but very few passengers frequent the shop, most are just sitting for their buses. The waiting hall is a massive structure, and it houses all of the little passengers off to their various destinations - Beijing, Shenzhen (in the south), and Shenyang, etc. As we check in our tickets, we head out to the train platform and board a sleek white train that has a nose at one end. It's built in a tubular fashion and looks relatively new, probably built within the past 10 years. It's a sleek looking train, and the carts are numbered on the outside. We find ours and pile into the train. All this technology was able to be imported here very late in the game and so many things in China are state-of-the-art. But, despite the relatively modern infrastructure of the train, the Chinese people still stick true to their roots. There is endless chatter in the train and people yelling loudly into their phones. In the front seat, a man is spitting into a bag to clear his throat, as the train prepares to depart. Classical music plays loudly over the intercom that almost drowns out the noise in the train, but it doesn't work, as the different frequencies of peoples' voices breaks over the melodic tune. As the train goes a bit further, the chatter quiets down, with the exception of one man yelling into his phone. It's a rowdy scene in the train, and everyone is very lively, actively engaged in their own respective activities. The conductor comes to check tickets. We provide our passports to verify the ID, and as the silence of the train sets in we knock off, only to arrive in Shenyang for 20:00.</p>
