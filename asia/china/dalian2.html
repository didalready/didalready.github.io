      <p>‍</p>
      <p>I wake up at 8:45 but Thorin gets up at 10:30 since he needs to sleep in. I spend the morning just chilling in the urban concrete hostel and when Thorin gets up, I decide I have some business to finish and he is forced to accompany me. It's snowing today in Dalian. It's the first day I've ever spent in a place that has continued to snow.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>From the bank yesterday, they said I needed to get a phone number first, so that was the first line of business. I go to China Unicom on Shanghai Street and it's located in what appears to be an old brick building. To enter any place in Dalian that is warm, you have to make your way past these thick, mat-like barriers that cover the doors. The mats are similar to those thick plastic strips you see in refrigeration storage areas in supermarkets, meant to keep the area cold. Except, in the Dalian case, it's to keep the warmth within the premises and prevent cold air from getting in. In addition, it's not just thin plastic strips but, rather, thick wrestling-style mats that are dangling from the ceiling. Some of these are pretty heavy, and you have to exert a certain amount of effort in order to pass these barriers. Upon going into China Telecom , we push past this barriers and get inside.</p>
      <p>The telecom company is not like a modern one at all. Rather, it looks more like an old bank that was utilized to sell cell phone cards. When you go in, two ladies at a fold-out plastic desk ask what you need and then give you a waiting number. All of the staff are sat behind the 'bank teller' desks and when your number is called, you approach the appropriate counter. There are still metal bars that surround the staff, with each bar 'wrung out' so as to create a small twist in the bars, extending from about waist level to to the top of the help window. There is no glass blocking this area, presumably because it's only a telco place and not a bank. The interior has a dull linoleum padding to it and large marble columns that extend to the ceiling, retaining much of the antiquated bank image. I like how they've just converted the building to their needs without the need to completely renovate it into a new style telephone shop. To use the test phones, they are propped up on counters that were presumably used to write checks and fill out forms. I look at my number, and there are 15 people in front of me. The lady says I'll have to wait upwards of one hour.</p>
      <p>Getting a SIM card is one of those things that takes a lot more effort than not in China. Recall from the last post that there are things that are easy to do, then things that are more difficult, and getting a tourist SIM is definitely the latter. I have to wait one hour because I couldn't do it at one of the small SIM outlets scattered around the country. Likewise, I had to provide over a passport and buy into a 2-month prepaid plan in order to get it, costing a total of 20 Singaporean Dollars (about 14 USD) to do so. It's still pretty cheap for a 2 month data and call plan; however, the bureaucracy of needing to wait 1 hour and go through the formal branch of the company make it a bit difficult. Still, when you finish, there's a sense of accomplishment to the matter. I walk out with a Chinese SIM card, and am ready to head to the bank.</p>
      <p>On the way to the bank, we pass by Zhongshan Square which has some notable Russian architecture scattered around a circle. There are some bank headquarters there, including Bank of China and ICBC, the bank to which I was going to open an account. The buildings are arranged around one large roundabout with a singular circular grass patch in the middle. The grassy area is elevated slightly and you can reach it by going up two small stairs. This grass patch is intersected with a cross that perfectly aligns to the walkway that cuts through it. Meanwhile, the snow has covered the grass slightly giving it a green and white color. People are seen crossing the middle by going up the two steps and then down the two steps on the other side to cross the roundabout. I take a look around and see the development of China: the tall buildings (newly built ones) surrounding the roundabout are all nicely constructed in a serious demeanor. Dull, harsh colors that are sharp around the edges and rectangular. The ones that have a Russian influence usually have more sloped rooves with 'dunce hat' like protrusions on the side. It's the weirdest sight to see, that nmix of architectural influence, but it makes for a wonderful scene. And, like everything in China, the roundabout is absolutely huge. It takes about 2 minutes to walk across the entire middle at a fast-walkish pace.&nbsp;</p>
      <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center">
        <div><img src="images/dalian2_3.JPG">
        </div>
      </figure>
      <p>Around the roundabout there is a lady selling something, while bunched up next to a bunch of pigeons. The pigeons here are noticeably fluffier here since they've perked up their feathers to withstand the weather. Also accompanying these two species are another species: the snow sweeper. There are about 15 people dressed in bright orange wear, the kind you see inmates wear in the U.S., and they are equipped with thick winter clothing and a shovel and broom. Because the snow has stopped falling for about one hour, they are sweeping the powdery snow into piles so that it's easier for pedestrians to walk through the central ring. I look at them do their job and they are smiling to each other and chatting while sweeping away. It's below zero outside but even the harsh weather cannot deter the Chinese from making small conversation with each other, even while completing the most menial tasks. The true 老百姓 - common hundred people - at work here in the city. While we walk down past the Zhongshan area and further along towards Friendship Square, we also see some more sweepers. They are hard at work keeping the city safe. We see a guy with a huge broom that, with one sweep, gathers much of the snow into his neat little pile. He is working alone, with no one to chat to, but sings along to his headphones.&nbsp;</p>
      <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center">
        <div><img src="images/dalian2_4.JPG">
        </div>
      </figure>
      <p>With the snow on the ground, traveling on foot between areas is a little difficult. You have to step more gingerly and be cautious even at the smallest slopes due to the ice that forms. I was a little bit self conscious first moving through those spaces, but after a while I realized that no one really cares if you slip nor really cares if you fall on your ass. The reality is that it's a snowy city and it gets cold, and so if you occasionally fall, that's part of it. I even see a few people wearing heel-boots while walking in the snow. The most peculiar thing is how people are walking through the snow. Occasionally, you'll see people break into a light jog in trainers across the snow and ice. It doesn't seem like they're going anywhere in particular, but they do so to keep their body a bit warm. We've seen people do it for about 10 meters, some for about 50. They tuck their hands away in their pockets and put their head down and do a quick jog. Some people also do the shuffle, in which they slowly glide their feet along while dragging their soles, kicking up the light snow on the floor. This is presumably to get a better grip on the floor, which changes between concrete to marble material, and from flat to ridged patterns, and the combinations of texture and composition. People here also walk remarkably fast, probably in order to avoid the coldness while transiting from indoor to indoor. As you hit a wind tunnel and it kicks up the powdery snow and hits your face, the weather feels like it drops about 10 degrees further below zero, and the harsh winter chill hits your face. At this point, you just look down and keep powering through to your destination.</p>
      <p>While walking and observing people, we also pass by the crystal ball-ish thing that we saw the other day, which was actually the Friendship Square. Today since we went during the day, it hadn't been lit yet and so it was just a crystal ball that was in the middle of the roundabout. All around this ball there were tall skyscrapers built in the modern variety, with their long rectangular bodies and perfectly uniform windows sprinkled throughout. I started getting a feel for the skyline of Dalian, which was essentially these buildings stacked at alternating heights, with gems like the crystal ball tucked beneath. It's absolutely mesmerizing to look at the Chinese city. What would take probably years for another country to build once, China has done so at a scale that far surpasses any of them just due to the sheer amount of labor and the fierce work ethic. I'm waiting for someone to write a book that is the "Rise and Fall of Chinese Cities."&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The next place we go back to is the bank at ICBC, the same branch we went to. The day before, I'd actually left my deposit at the counter. As soon as I walk in, the lady that was there yesterday immediately says hello and goes to get the money that I left, profusely apologizing. I was worried that the staff there that day would not be there, but instead, all of the same people were working there that day. It was the 26th and they went back to work; there was no day off since China doesn't celebrate it. When walking in everyone greeted me as if I was a regular customer, and the guy that helped me yesterday was super friendly and offered to fill out my form again (since when I did it it was absolutely too slow). When I got to the counter, the same lady helped me and also profusely apologized for forgetting to return my money, and she proceeded to help me finish opening the account. This time, her supervisor was standing behind her and watching, only smiling at me occasionally. Another lady, also her supervisor, was watching over her to help with the opening of the account. I guess in a city like Dalian it wasn't too common for foreigners to open bank accounts. And so, just like that, I was the proud owner of a Chinese bank account. It felt like I was already on my way moving here, having opened a bank account and set up my SIM card. But, that was enough bureaucracy for the day. I left the bank and thanked everyone and they snmiled and said "再見美國小伙子" - goodbye, young American guy.</p>
      <p>We decide to go for lunch at the underground mall and end up talking to a lady and getting some warm noodles that hit the spot. After that, we returned to our hostel to relax for a bit and figure out what to do next.</p>
      <p>Back on the topic of Chinese cities, I want to put in a slight sociological critique. Thorin often talks about the modern shopping mall -- say, Westfield for instance -- as a nonspace. What he means by that is that you can take a Westfield in Australia (that's where the company is based, did you know?) and a Westfield in the United States and chances are they will be pretty similar. Modern malls like that are built in such a way that they resemble each other and are culturally inane. They only have many chain stores that sell all the same products, and are probably mandated by contract to appear similarly throughout the different seasons.</p>
      <p>In China, there are high end malls that looks similar. For example, the Pavilion mall that we lived near also had high end shops, and when we walked inside there were glossy floors and high end shops throughout. We immediately walked out since we knew we'd probably be unable to afford anything in there and it wasn't so interesting to us. It's a feeling of staleness to the malls that makes it uninteresting, even if it is meant to be high end. We much prefer the malls that have independent clothing stores so that you can find something with more special flavor. When you buy something second hand or cheap that is fashionable, it makes the purchase more rewarding.</p>
      <p>I now want to extend the concept of the nonspace mall to the Chinese city. Because development has really happened within the past 10-15 years, a lot of these cities have sprung up so quickly that culture hasn't had time to set in. Similarly for housing, there hasn't been time to effectively design each building since what matters more is housing the millions of people that live in each city, as opposed to 'giving them the most luxurious looking building to live in.' In a sense then, many modern Chinese cities can be seen as non-spaces since there's nothing really special about them, architecturally speaking at least. They are all beuatiful, of course, but they are not special in their own way. I mentioned this briefly in the previous post, but many people will praise Chinese engineering and production speed but criticize design quality and finesse. This is most curious because only China as a nation (I think, at this time) is capable of orgainzing development on a scale as large as this. Instead of building mall non-spaces, they are building at a large scale and building city non-spaces: all resembling each other slightly, without any distinguishing buildings on the skyline. But, they are all marvelous to look at from the pure feat of speed of engineering. You look at the development of Dalian and around the various places and just say, "whoa", because it's so vast and expansive. It looks like it took 50 years to build a city when in reality it took probably a fraction of that time. It's an extraordinary undertaking and such a strong sense of order is needed to do so that you can't help but marvel in the accomplishment of the Chinese government. It's a bit like the Burj Khalifa. All I could do when I saw it was gasp and then laugh at the ridiculous thought of building something that big to display to the world, as if to say, "Look at what we can do, and look at what we can afford with our money." And, we all know, money is power.</p>
      <p>So, as the Chinese nonspace city comes to rise, yes, perhaps it's devoid of any kind of cultural value but that in itself&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the cultural significance. It's the fact these model cities have been modeled and replicated at this large scale in neutral display. However, there is one redeeming quality. There are pockets of small culture that bleed into the modern city. Dalian is an old Russian city, and so in some buildings you are able to see some influence. Some areas are also Japanese influenced, and so you will see some Japanese things scattered around. As China developed and built these modern buildings, there has been some erasure of this, but the culture still lingers and add a bit of 特色, unique quality, to the cities.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>While on the topic of pockets of culture, I'd like to talk about Christmas in Dalian. There are only lights decorating the streets (especially Zhongshan Road), but no real Christmas-y aspect to it. There is a Christmas tree in front of the Pavilion mall that people are taking selfies in front of, but even then the culture is very weak. The only time we really see any Christmas culture is when we walk by some pharmacies that have a Christmas soundtrack playing on loop. It's not your classic American or British Christmas music, rather, it's kids singing your classics in an uptempo beat. When we walk past a pharmacy, we hear "Dashing through the snow, in a one horse open sleigh..!" sung by a choir of kids. Another time, we hear "Jingle bells, Jingle bells..!" passing through another small shop, also sung by a choir of kids. There are only a handful of shops that are doing this. For a country that does not celebrate Christmas, we find it in small pockets just like we do the bits of Chinese culture that are not overshadowed -- or crowded out -- by the modern buildings. So, throughout the city when we hear these tunes, they are tastes of home for us. A home somewhere in our hearts that celebrates Christmas, and has presents, and has Santa, and has a holiday spirit to it. A home that has mulled wine while eating minced pies for Thorin, and a home that eats hotpot and roasts marshmallows by the fire for me. When the songs come on they remind us of our Christmas memories. But here in China, they fade as the decibels fall off as we walk further and further away. They exist only in pockets, and, unavoidably even the City has swallowed its tune. Everytime we walk back, we get to hear the tune again -- even on boxing day -- and it reminds us of Home.</p>
      <p>We decide that night to go to the People's Square. Apparently, it's a small park that has some lawns in front of it and there is some open space to walk around and admire the scenery. Everyday at 8pm there is a light show and you can see some elderly Chinese folk dancing around. Since it seems like a cute little thing, we decide to walk over in the bitter cold.</p>
      <p>When we arrive, it is a small park that is dimly lit. The fountain that is normally functioning in the summer has shut off for the winter, and a thin layer of snow covers the rim of the fountain edge. Someone has written a Chinese inscription into the snow with a stick. Meanwhile, aunties, uncles, and young people alike all walk around the pathways that intersect this park. When we get to the more central bit, we see a line of old men and women that are dancing together. They're arranged around a rectangular shape and are moving in a counter-clockwise position. In the middle of the rectangle is a small stereo system that is playing out a Chinese techno song. While the song plays in its "un ts un ts" beat, there is a lady in the recording that is telling the dance moves to the dance crowd, and they follow suit. They keep walking, and occasionally they pause and their arms swing either outwards or forwards for a bit, then continue to march. It's like watching a human sushi revolving belt in action. Watching old people dance in unison is probably a very common sight in China; however, I find it one of the most refreshing aspects of the old generation here. Sometimes you'll see them walking along and singing to themselves, or they'll get up on stage and sing karaoke and dance. Other times, you'll see them chatting with each other uproarously, or playing chess together with a crowd slowly gathering. When I watch them dance, I watch one of the most basal human activities being embodied in the most unlikely of places, by the most unlikely of people. There's a nonchalance and joy to their movement that you would not see in the West.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>As Thorin and I walk around the square, we notice some other large buildings off in the distance that are opposite of the People's Square. We're not sure as to what these buildings are, but they're all built in an expansive, sharp rectangular manner, probably brown in color, owing to the marble. They're stern buildings, probably more Beijing-lite in terms of seriousness, but they are still daunting to look at. They're relatively simplistic in design, only having Chinese characters printed on the top with one or a few Chinese flags raised in the middle. It's stuck on the front lawn of the building that stretches for an equal amount of land as the building does (or, it would seem so). The People's Park is directly across the 4 or 5 lane road from it. The snow has been undisturbed on the lawns, and only perturbed in the walkways from the shuffling of the locals who fancy a stroll at night. Large lanterns are hung in the park as well for good luck - lanterns that are also strangely big. As we walk around, it has a certain Christmas In The Park feel with the lights strung around, without all of the festivities. When the windchill picks up, we decide it's time to leave.&nbsp;</p>
      <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center">

      </figure>
      <p>We walk for a good 40 or so minutes in the cold, and as the wind picks up it gets a bit harder to endure through our flimsy jackets. While we walk down ZhongShan street, there are blue and white Christmas lights strung around the trees and the span all the way from where we walk to the city center. The buildings are also all newly constructed and large, and are lit nicely in the nighttime. I've never been in a city quite like it, it feels like you're walking along airbase hangars since you're just a small speck among the big city. There's hardly anyone on the roads, pedestrians and cars alike, and it feels strangely empty, like a business district after hours.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>But, we keep walking down the wide road ahead of us. We occasionally pass by people and wonder, "where on earth did you come from?" We eventually get to the center and duck and find shelter in a Shaanxi noodle shop, where the "Taste of China" series is playing on the TV. The series is almost considered the "Planet Earth" of China, and instead of detailing the natural world it details the culinary world of China. Shaanxi province has a very special noodle making process and as we order our beef noodles, we watch the man in the back twist the dough and wrap it around itself, and while he pulls the dough apart with his two hands he slams the middle portion down on the cooking board, allowing the dough blow out from below it. He does this a few times and then finally cuts the dough up to serve as noodles. We enjoy a bowl of Shaanxi noodles in Shenyang, while some other fierce Dong Bei people walk in and order their meals.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>When we finish and go outside, we find a Uighur man selling his characteristic "Naan" bread, which we just call Uighur bread. He's standing out in the cold with his friend, with both of their hands hovered over the oven that makes these flatbreads. The man is brunette, with deep set eyes and a sharp nose and a roughened face. He looks Turkish and has a furrow to his brow. His friend is Han Chinese and so looks more like your typical Chinese mainlander. As Thorin orders in Chinese to a man that looks like he&nbsp;<em>shouldn't</em>&nbsp;speak Chinese, he looks at him strangely. We then look at him strangely because we're unsure as to whether or not he speaks Chinese (we think that most Uighurs, having grown up within Chinese borders, do speak a bit of Chinese). There seems to be a stranger stalemate in which the other party stares at each other, until the silence is broken by the Uighur man who holds up all 5 fingers, indicating the price to us. We pay him and say thank you in Chinese, and he gives one last weird look to us. Maybe he wasn't sure if Thorin was Uighur, or just another foreigner who happens to speak English. Either way, both have to be rare occurrences.</p>
      <p>This interaction plays in to the larger understanding of regional variation in China, a theme which I will touch on somewhat in the subsequent entries. At night, we're happy to finally tuck back into our hostel as the snowy day finally comes to an end, and most of the snow on the ground has melted and frozen over to ice.</p>
