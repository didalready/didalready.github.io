      <p>‍</p>
      <p>From the previous post about Dandong, I talked about the arbitrariness of borders. Maybe there are geographical separations, but most likely a border is political; disputed, and points of contention and delineation. Today is New Years Eve, and I talk about the arbitrariness of time. We define ourselves by special days we pass by. Birthdays, holidays, anniversaries. We punctuate these moments in our lives and give them meaning. We also perform rituals and rites: activities to make them special. "Congratulations on being 50. You've made it through 18,250 days, and clocked 438,000 hours." "Congratulations on your 50th wedding anniversary, you've (suffered) through 18,250 days of marriage, and have known someone for 438,000 hours." And so here I am, standing in China on New Years Eve 2016, thinking about what it means to be here on New Years Eve. One reason I came to China was because Christmas and New Years were not strong ceremonial concepts. They are additional days to just party. Walking around helps clarify this. When you ask people what they're doing, they mostly go about their lives. There is no vacation time, and it's just another day. A far cry from what I'm used to.</p>
      <p>It's strange how I also tie important days to the environment around me. I always associate Christmas with somewhere that's cold and wet. California, this time of year, is usually stormy and cold. You can wake up and it is a balmy 15 degrees. Sometimes it's a sunny day, sometimes it's that consistent grey cover with harsh winds. Either way, I get excited, because school's out for two weeks. I know I'll be over at my cousin's house as Christmas gets close. This usually involves a big family meal, hanging out with my cousins, and getting to open gifts at the Eve of Christmas Day. There's a warmth in that house, something about getting together with everyone and being a part of something. The holly is strung around their staircase handles, all the way up to the second floor, and there is a Christmas tree that faces the bay window, whose shades are always drawn, but the light of the trees shine through from inside so that its silhouette is visible as my family pulls into the driveway. Then, the next year, maybe a few years down the line, it becomes me pulling in separately in my car because I got my license that year. We miss a few members since they've gone off to college, or have moved abroad. Same for New Years, we usually count down together. Millenium year was a big one, we had all the extended family over. As the years passed into the new decade, the numbers fluctuated but the rituals didn't.</p>
      <p>We all get older, and we all pass time at the same rate, but we don't pass space in the same ways. I'll never forget those moments. They stay with me as I look around China, and it is cold and wet, but this time there is no family. I'm living abroad, and with my boyfriend. He's with me, and we are having this experience together. There's no more ritual in a foreign country, and I hold onto my nostalgia while the external environment that also molds me -- the one that doesn't have these New Years Rituals. New Years Eve 2016 is then not really a thing today, it becomes another day of sightseeing, and then, hanging out with the hostel to pass the time together. First though, breakfast:&nbsp;</p>

      <p>China is home to two large religions, Taoism and Buddhism. We've seen our fair share of Buddhist temples throughout the area, but we haven't had a chance to explore Taoist temples. There is a small Taoist temple tucked away, also swallowed by the developed infrastructure around it. It's a small two RMB to enter. The lady in the front has a very happy disposition and greets us in an upbeat, Southern Chinese accent. She smiles and says "兩個人民幣!', "Two Renminbi!" Her smile is unwavering and it does not move down even in the slightest at the sight of Thorin, with whom I'm with. Thorin responds with a 好 and then we walk in. I can't distinguish the intricacies between Taoist and Buddhist temples, but I'm still in awe of the place. Something about it in Winter, I can't quite put my finger on it. There is stillness in the air, and not a breeze blows by. There is serenity as you often find in temples, completely detached from the world outside of it. Monks are walking around the grounds as well and occasionally look at the tourists taking pictures, but mostly go on their own business. They're not shaved like the Buddhist monks, rather, they wear their hair long. It's tied up into a bun, just like in a Chinese Drama period piece fashion, and their robes dangle down to their legs. They travel swiftly between rooms so as to not get cold. The colors are bright like the Buddhist temple, with the reds and greens, blues and golds contrasting heavily to the dark gray bricks that constitute most of its foundation. A small layer of snow on top completes the aesthetic. An Audi parked in the temple grounds looks out of place, but at least they chose black, a color that goes with everthing. These are the intricacies and marks of modernized China, at the Taoist temple. But, people here are holding onto their traditions as well. People stop in and pray to the Gods, and then swiftly move on their way.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>When we finish making our rounds, we head back to the hostel. On the way back, we pass by the main gate into the Forbidden Palace in Shenyang, home to the Qing Dynasty. We don't do anything else today was we want to take it easy, so today was just visiting the Taoist temple.</p>
      <p>---</p>
      <p>The Northern Chinese are serious about their dumplings. The tradition here is to wrap dumplings in the Spring Festival new year, but they have transferred this practice to the Western New Year. The night starts off with all of the dumpling stuffing prepared. It's a raw mixture, composed of pork meat and 酸菜, which is a Northeastern Chinese specialty vegetable. In essence, it's a soaked cabbage that is often found in stews, and dumplings. The night is a mix of people, coming from all parts of China. There are people from Sichuan province, from Hong Kong, and there are the Northerners. They have come from all over and it feels like an international get together even though they are from the same country. Everyone has a chance to introduce themselves and people have gathered here from all over to celebrate New Years, or, 跨年, together. The translation literally means to 'cross over into the year', which is the word they have used to describe Western New Year. So, we begin to wrap. I have always thought that eating dumplings was a Chinese tradition, but it's found more often year-round in the north, and country-wide during the new years.</p>
      <p>There's an art to wrapping dumplings. You can't put too much stuffing in, the way you pinch around to create the classical "U-bend" has to be done in a way that's precise. But, they don't actually measure it by weights and scales. It's purely be feeling. However much stuffing you think you need is the right amount to put in. If it's too much, you know because it overflows from the side when you pinch together. There's practice involved in perfecting it, and you can distinguish the Northerners' and Southerners' dumplings by the way they do it. Some dumplings have a small 10 cent Yuan coin put into it - if you were the lucky person to bite into the coin, then it's symbolic of good luck for the new year. And so we wrap, and chat. A group of some guys goes over to the counter to drink some hard alcohol, the Chinese kind. It's some sort of 白酒, baijiu, that has a sharp, pear flavored kick to it that is impossible to forget once you drink it. However, it's just as polarizing as, say, Tequila. Some people love it, and some people hate it, but either way it goes down with a nice burn. And then, after that, the night goes to drinking and chatting. The projector screen falls down on the side of the wall and the karaoke tracks begin rolling out. Thorin and I are the only ones who sing English so we put on the Spice Girls for everyone. Then, another girl and I start singing Teresa Teng classics. It's all a blur, but I'm happy.</p>
      <p>I'm surprised by the differences between the northerners and the southerners. They naturally congregate amongst each other and it's interesting to see how different they are. The Northerners love to drink, the southerners are not as forthright with their desire to. I find the southerners a little more friendly and engaging; willing to talk to me as a 'foreigner' and get to know me. I stumble my way through the words but appreciate their sincerity. The northerns skirt around small talk and talk very honestly and open, and speak very directly. There's a certain awkwardness to the conversation because they're not sure if I can speak fluent Chinese (I can't, and a lot of the intricacies of the humor I can't get), and so the conversation remains very shallow. But, as the tequila and baijiu keep flowing, the conversation gets easier. The northerners can drink like fish and they continue to do so at an unprecedented rate, shooting alongside Thorin and me. The southerners also partake but at more apportioned rates. Everyone is enjoying themselves, and the place livens up.</p>
      <p>About 2 minutes before New Years, they gather everyone together to take a picture. I'm not even sure how we manage to get a selfie but we do, and count down together. Three, two, one, and everyone is in some state or another, giving hugs and kisses, and shouting things. There is no backtrack of Auld Lang Syne, nor is there a feed of Rockin' New Years' Eve playing in the background. There's no ball drop. My family isn't here, they're about 16 hours behind and looking forward to their own New Years celebration probably a day later. There are no traditions or celebrations that I'm used to today on New Years, and as quietly as 2016 crept in, so it has left and we have "crossed over" into the new year, as the Chinese would say it. As arbitrary as Time is, I realize that the reason we have our moments to celebrate is because there's a sense of community and belonging. There is a familiarity of old friends, and an ease of pleasant company. So as nontraditional or anti celebratory as I make myself out to be, I hold onto and cherish my old memories and look forward to making many more, in different ways; in different places. I'm warmed by memory of the fireplace at my cousins house, and wish I could be there with them. But here, it's just another day, and as I said, the environment molds me. I don't dwell, and down that next shot of 白酒. It's going to be a good night -- a good year.</p>
