      <h2>SHENYANG, LIAONING, CHINA</h2>
      <h3>DAY 12, 13: WU AI MARKET, EAST TOMB</h3>
      <h4>2017-02-16, 16:28, JASON</h4>
      <h4><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-wR2s2IVNQhhxj-0irDpt_ntnFAhj694yjaQeTBhnGc/edit?usp=sharing">BUDGET&nbsp;</a>, STAY: SUPER 8 HOTEL</h4>
      <p>‚Äç</p>
      <p>We took a train from Harbin to Shenyang. We&nbsp;backtracked and followed our path coming up, but instead headed back down towards Dalian. Since it'd be awkward to re-stay at the hostel that we just came from for New Years, we just decided to book out a Super 8 Hotel down Zhong Jie, which is the main shopping street in Shenyang. It's like all the other major Chinese shopping streets, spanning for about 4 or 5 blocks, with various high end and pop up shops scattered throughout. There may even be mall offshoots in which there's a mall with its own underground stuff to do.</p>
      <p>The next morning, we wake up and decide to go to Wu Ai Market, which is a wholesale market; a place where you can find decent stuff by haggling with the various tenders. It's in the same direction as -- if you remember -- the Shenyang Church that we went to before going to Harbin. We stop by a small bakery on the way in to get a snack.</p>
      <p>The bakery is still playing Christmas music, the odd arrangement of American classics arranged in a lighter, atmospheric ballad way. Some of the shop is still decorated with Christmas stuff even though it's the New Year and Christmas was about 2 weeks behind us. Again, even past Christmas and NY, we're still reminded of a place that merely has the decorations up for sake of decoration. It's like back in the suburban U.S. when everyone's too lazy to take down their lights and so they're left up for another 10 months, until we realize that "Oh, Christmas is so near" and so we just leave them on a bit longer. The cycle continues. Here, they must've just not gotten around to taking it down.</p>
      <p>The woman greets us at the door and smiles, looking at us. In Shenyang, as we've found, there still haven't been that many foreigners as it's not a tourist hot spot, so Thorin is still considered pretty rare. I don't know if the following happens because he's white, or because we're clearly foreign, but I've noticed this with Chinese service and shall detail it here.</p>
      <p>The Chinese are good with their service. I think service culture here shows a degree of respect. Sometimes, I'll see the service folks -- whether at a pharmacy, a bakery, wherever -- walking around on the floor helping customers. This can be very off-putting for some people that come from countries where they are more used to shopping alone. Usually, if I walked into a small Boots or something in London, I'd expect to be finding my own stuff and seeking help from associates if I need it. In China, it's different - they come up to you and they help you. They not only do that, but they hover a bit and watch you as you consider whether or not you want the cherry or lemonade chapstick flavor. They're incredibly knowledgeable about their products. When Thorin and I first went in to buy a lotion for the start of the trip, the lady asked us if we wanted thick or thin. Then she asked if we wanted fragrant or not so fragrant. When we answered, she was able to narrow down two lotions and give us an option that fit our selection.</p>
      <p>So in this bakery today there are two girls who are smiling at us and watching us get bread. There's an immense amount of pressure as we're not used to it, but we're slowly trying to accustom ourselves to the notion that they're not trying to pressure us, they're just seeing if we need help. They're, in essence, doing their job. And, we are in a foreign country, so there are likely to be local ways of doing business and customer service. But, we still can't help our upbringing. We sift through quickly and do a quick scan of all the great baked goods in front of us and then pick out two. While deciding on coffee I linger a little too long and then I can feel the laser eyes of the robot Bakery Workers Association drilling a hole in my chin as its tilted up and deciding "Hm. Espresso or Americano." Normally I'd get the espresso, but as we are going to be seated and chatting, I go for the long drink. Thorin goes for the short.</p>
      <p>We polish off our pastries and then head south. Thorin's developed some kind of whooping cough and he keeps coughing up nothing from his chest. It's rough, but we're still having a good time.</p>
      <p>Wu Ai Market can only be described as a maze. There are about 6 stories of shops that are filled everywhere. Luckily, the mens' options are more limited and so it makes it easier to navigate, but there are things strewn everywhere. The stalls are all just a small walk-in with clothes lining the three faces. There are clothes on the ground. There are people standing around and in some stalls there are men changing their pants out in the open. Of course, right? You have to see how it looks before you try it on. As we're all spent out on clothes what we are mostly looking for is just the feel of the place. So, we spend two hours walking around and around. The clothes, at this point, all begin to look somewhat similar. The style seems to blend together: some odd combination of a loud pattern on a shirt with a drop crotch long pants. Mostly all black.</p>
      <p>The Chinese are actually really fashionable, but not in the way that you'd expect. I think it takes a certain kind of sense to appreciate it, but I've always found it refreshing. And, by fashion I'm talking about the men's fashion. I can't really comment on the womens' style here. The first is the loud pattern. These loud patterns usually manifest itself as some kind of patchwork on jeans or on a sweater. We've seen everything from dragons rolling up one side of the pant leg, to tigers popping out of sweatshirts, to multiple patches of animals on jeans, or sometimes only patches on the pockets. They're not totally baggy, in fact, they're tailored quite closely to the leg, and there may be even a small upturn of the cuff to reveal the lighter, inner lining of the pants. The shoes also range from those pseudo-Italian glitzy gigolo shoes to timberland boots. If there is a loud pattern on the pants then the top will usually be paired with something pretty docile. If there is not a loud pattern on the pants, most likely you'll see it on the jacket. Think a more subdued, less biker version of Ed Hardy, but still having that Ed Hardy loud patternation. It's definitely a DGAF look, but I like it. It's not streamlined or sexy like the Korean fashion you see now. It's not always tailored and tight fitting, but it's loud and branded. In the West, if we saw that, we'd think a bit that it wasn't too tasteful, or that it was gaudy. But, in China, at least here in the mall in Shenyang, the brilliance of the fashion doesn't necessarily lie within the pairing of the clothes, it's the embodiment and total commitment to the effort. Here, I don't think it's considered tacky if you wore all the brands and loud clothes. It's that kind of ignorance to 'appropriate wear', as we would define it in the West, that makes it so special, because they're not thinking about necessarily looking bad, they think they actually look pretty good in it, and they're owning it. I admire that confidence, and I really like all the street style I've seen. It's like nothing you see in the other fashion capitals like in Japan or Korea.</p>
      <p>The hair, too, is pretty cool. Dong Bei guys mostly have this kind of short bowl look, in which they have really short hair on the sides, and the top will be a tuft of hair that's thicker. It's kind of like a bowl haircut, but it doesn't have the length to it. This is just a small majority of people that we've seen though. Most people on the street have .. normal people hair, for lack of a better word, but the haircuts here can be as edgy as the outfits themselves.</p>
      <p>While we are walking, I see a young guy dash behind and in front of me and say something along the lines of "Oh, she's coming!" As we walk about 10 seconds more, the next thing we notice is a women yelling at one of the shop owners over something, and the shop owner returning that lip and yelling at the lady. There must've been some argument over the deal that was being haggled. The man that rushed behind me earlier was standing there watching, and slowly a crowd began to form. People were trying to get onto the ramp to watch, and people on the next level up, in the side directly opposite of the fight, were also watching. They continued to yell for about 3-4 minutes as the crowd gathered, and, when the fight seemed to slowly trickle out, the crowd also dispersed. Not a single person said anything, but they just watched as this unfolded.</p>
      <p>I mention the fight not to criticize it but to point out a peculiarity in the formation of a Chinese crowd. Most Chinese people on the street usually mind their own business and move along their way, but for some reason when a fight breaks out they all watch to gather. I don't know why, whether out of curiosity or what, but it happens. They don't heckle and encourage, not in this case, they're just watching events unfold. It's like an appreciation for the change of scenery in everyday life.</p>
      <p>Anyway, that's what we get from Wu Ai Market. Like it is with all malls in Shenyang, we also notice a small food area while we're walking, so we stop for a bit and then have some more ÈÖ∏Ëæ£, sour and spicy, noodles just on the side. There's no seating so we plop down against a shop and just eat. When we leave Wu Ai Market, we go again to the cathedral and it's a great, blue day to appreciate some religion, and so we just stroll around the front of the area.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The sky is blue today, a well deserved change after the past week or so of pollution that began settling in as we left Shenyang. We don't get up to much else on this day, I think we've begun to wind down. We head again into Xi Ta street - hailing cabs in both trips (I'm very proud to hail and negotiate with a Chinese taxi) - to have Korean dinner. It's just as fun as we remember it the first time, and just as Korean. We eat and drink Soju until we head in for the night.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>--- Day 13 ---</p>
      <p>Today is the last big sightseeing day. We decide to head to the East Tomb in which the first Qing emperor was buried. It's actually not that easy of a site to reach, by taxi approximately 15 minutes and so all hope of us going there by mass public transport are hopeless. It's only now that we realize the area of Shenyang was probably very different before development, since the tomb exists in solace in the outskirts of the city, arguably in the suburbs of Shenyang. It's a different side to China once again, and these cities are constantly offering me a different perspective on what it means to "live in China."</p>
      <p>As we drive out the buildings become do become more sparse, and they become lower rise. It almost then starts reminding me of the suburbs back at home. I begin to wonder if the China I've seen so far is just a small bit of the vast diversity in this country in terms of living styles. What about those in the countryside - the rural areas, without access? Development has happened here in the past 40 years, and surely some people have been left behind.</p>
      <p>The East Tomb is peaceful, just like the North Tomb. There're no tour buses here, and there aren't many people. It's not as grandiose as the North Tomb that holds the second emperor of the Qing. The layout is similar: one long stretch of land that leads up to the mausoleum, and some informational pickets along the way to guide the process. As it is with China in the winter, you can feel the history respirating through the earth, through the lightly powdery snow drizzled on it. I feel like an old uncle walking in the Chinese way, hands folded behind the back, and gliding slowly down the promenade up to see a dead person. I'm having a light conversation with Thorin who is next to me, walking the same way. We feel like an old gay uncle couple strolling through Ancient China. The air is still and fresh, the pollution having cleared. So, we walk, and we read about the great last dynasty of China. I read about the inspirations for the construction of this tomb; how, being the first tomb after the Ming dynasty, they draw significant influence from Ming styles. The stretch leading to the mausoleum is still very long -- it is China, after all.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Within one of the buildings, there is a small museum documenting all of the Qing tombs in China, of which most are in the Hebei province that surrounds Beijing. We browse through the posters, walking across about 200 years of Chinese history.&nbsp;</p>
      <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center">

      </figure>
      <p>When we get to the last emperor, the tomb is not grandiose like the one in which we stand. In fact, it's not a tomb at all, rather, maybe a small cemetery where his ashes lay. In 5 minutes, you're able to walk across Dynastic China one last time, and witness the fall from grace, the change from the dynastic system to the Republic state. No more emperor. We make our way onto the tomb walls and do one last circle of the place as we head out. It's hard to believe that so much tradition and culture was here at some point, on this very earth which we stand.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>For lunch, we duck into one of these small suburban shops, which is still located under a housing complex. The menus have all become very familiar now, and are composed of a series of pictures hung on the wall with their names written in Chinese under it. We do our pointing and ordering, eat, and then head back into the city for the night.</p>
      <p>ZhongJie - middle street - is the main shopping street in Shenyang. It's where young people can be seen on dates, by themselves, or, like in the case we saw, giving a proposal. There's such a dynamic character to it that, I can't really explain why, but I love to just walk down the street. There are so many characters on this mall, whose bright neon lights and signboards contribute to the light pollution in the sky. Everytime you walk or go somewhere, there is someone doing something that's worth watching -- perhaps that's why I like walking around in China. Something's always sparking your interest, whether it's a fight in the main Wu Ai market, or a pine tree planted at the tomb that has grown in a certain shape; the way the snow falls and sits on the tomb roof. It's the change of landscape of going from the historical, cultural ambience of the East Tomb to an industrialized shopping street that represents modern China. It's walking around and then seeing a bunch of aunties do a dance on the street in unison, then seeing the big letters WAL * MART inscribed onto the building; the brands staring you in their face. I then look at the young urbanites that are shopping together, the strive to be fashionable and relevant, and turn to see the uncle wearing a thick jacket, broom and pan in opposite hands, sweeping up the street. It's the nexus of these events and their counterparts that inspire me to further understand this country and its people.&nbsp;</p>
