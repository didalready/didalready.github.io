      <p>‍</p>
      <p>From Shenyang, Dandong is about 1.5 hours away by a high speed train. The city is famous for being on the North Korean border, and many Chinese will go to the city to see North Korean land. We decided to head there for a day trip since our schedule was pretty flexible.</p>
      <p>We wake up at 05:30 and make our way to the local breakfast joint that we've been going to for the past 2 days. It's a place where you can get good soymilk, buns, oil sticks, and some pickled vegetables to go with your rice porridge. The translation sounds horrible, I know, but I promise you it's good. When we get in, there is already a group of people in there opening up some boxes. They are all wearing an orange vest, the kind that you see construction workers wear, and on the back it says 衛生環保 - Health and Environmental Protectors. Some of them are wearing a bright neon green vest as well, the kind that reflect light. They are the street cleaners and the snow sweepers of the city, unboxing their new uniforms. Aunties and Uncles, excited about their new outfits, trying them on and chatting endlessly with a smile on their face. There's a certain joy in that moment while we order our food. Some of them take out their cell phones and take pictures of themselves, and also line up holding up their jackets with a proud smile. After they finish, they also order some food. Together, we are the first customers of the day.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The Old in China have a resilience to them, much like the older generation in a lot of Southeast Asia. Most of them are products of war and famine, and understand the struggle of survival. The ones in China have come through the transition of the Old China into Modern China, and have seen the rise of communism, the time of Mao, the death of Mao, the time of Deng and his death as well. They wear it on their faces as much as they do on their attitude, with their blasse mannerisms and nonchalance. I can especially appreciate this aspect to their existence, because there's a certain tradition of China that they keep with them, and a sense of honesty they have in their character. This, combined with being from the north where the weather is generally more rough and people are more direct, the older generation are incredibly lively and 'no bullshit.' They yell across each other, they push and they shove, but it's not out of rudeness, rather, out of necessity. It's about getting what you want, it's about getting where you need to get, and it's about survival. They've been doing it for their whole life, and have made them exist today. So, when I see them today in the coffee shop celebrating their new uniforms with a smile, it's a very small matter to me but it's an genuine expression of joy. When they take pictures, it's an honest expression of excitement. The same joy that has also allowed them to not only survive, but not thrive in a changing China.</p>
      <p>We got lucky with the train out of Shenyang to Dandong, because it just so happened that it was sunrise. Before coming here, many people told us not to go to Northeast China for the winter because it's cold. Fair enough, coming from Singapore it's a bit different, but I've never been more glad to come during the winter than today, where the sun was rising behind the high-rise horizon in front of us. Hundreds of buildings off in the distance, looking so tiny like some miniature Lego construction off in the distance. As the train sped on, the sun peeked through from behind them and lit up a silhouette of an industrial city. When we crossed the river, something about the angle that the sun was hitting the frozen river, and then later the snow-covered plains was perfect. Despite all of the high rises in China in the horizon, there was still vast space between us and them. There's just a lot of land here in general; with the high population density you would think that there was no one living just outside in the suburbs of Shenyang for miles. We were lucky to get the seat facing the sunrise, just watching it go for miles as we began our adventure for the day.</p>

      <p>Since the trip was early, I knocked off as the sun continued to rise, making its way up the horizon. The scenery out of Shenyang was similar to the images of industrial London back in the day. The buildings were all built out of brick and sturdy material, and many chimneys were spitting out thick smoke as the coal burned for energy. Since the weather was still cold, most of the buildings were covered with a fine layer of snow, while some of the snow on the ground had either been cleared or turned to ice. As you travel out, it's like other train station, with all the wires above and tracks below crossing each other, creating a kidn of urban jungle scene. Crossing the river, it begins to clear up a bit, there are no longer buildings nearby but they are off in the distance with the sun behind them.</p>
      <p>After I woke up the first time, all I saw was a blanket of white snow, occasionally interrupted by small patches of brown land that were peeking through. There was a thin layer of fog (or smog, I wasn't really quite sure) covering the land and there were no large buildings in sight. It almost looked more like the English countryside, with the expansive rolling hills and blanket of snow surrounding it. It had a mystical aspect to it, almost as if we were in some fairy tale place drawn from a C.S. Lewis novel. It was a bit surreal, having just come from a place where you couldn't see past about 100 meters in front of you since it was blocked by concrete. Out here in the countryside, when the train drives by, what you see is just country and farmland for miles. Occasionally, we passed by some cluster of houses that probably comprised a village. It looked out of place, stuck in the middle of nowhere, with no open road leading to it, but there it was. A layer of fresh snow covering each house with no sign of chimney smoke, as if abandoned. Then, I fell asleep again.&nbsp;</p>

      </figure>
      <p>When I woke up, it was just a little bit before the call for arrival in Dandong. As you pull in, the landscape also changes again. You still see the village tucked into the valley of two hills, but like when we left Shenyang, the sights of tall buildings begin to appear again. Hotels start popping up, and so do housing quarters of the Chinese. The train pulls into the station and, being the last stop, empties out into the station, and we find our way out.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>When we walk out, we notice two things. First, the train station of Dandong. Similar to the other stations that you see in China: a large concrete or brick building. On top of it, metal sticks propping up the name of the station: 丹東. Below that, the English pin-yin spelling: DAN DONG. That's it. There are other small signs directing you to where you purchase tickets, where you pick up tickets, and where you wait for the trains. All of it looks like the same mold of train station. Nothing spectacular, just huge , but in that blandness, something oddly daunting; with a certain presence. Second, there is one statue of Mao saluting in one direction. We've seen a couple of Mao statues throughout other cities, but this one is particularly noticeable as it's just right outside the station. Below it, there are some flowers laid out by people, and there is one woman who sets down a bouquet of flowers for modern China's founding father (a figure that was actually not particularly liked, when compared to his successor Deng Xiaoping). The Mao statue is built like the train station, simple and big. I'm not sure what material it is, but it has a black-brownish exterior and very little intricacy in its carving. You can generally make out the shape of his face and hairline, arguably his most distinguishing aspects. It's propped up on some marble stage as well, with an inscription written on the bottom. But, that's it. No fornmal, written political statement or anything, unless you consider the presence of a huge Mao statue rightoutside the station a statement.&nbsp;</p>

      </figure>
      <p>We have one plan today which is to go see a section of the Great Wall that is closest to Dandong, called 虎山長城. This translates to Tiger Mountain Great Wall. It's about a 40 minute bus ride away. We look around for the bus, and while we do a man tries to sell us a bargain of a 30 RMB one-way tri to the Great Wall. We say we're going to sit on the bus, and he keeps pushing. I ask him a little bit more about the deal and he explains what this 30 one-way bit includes, but we stick to our guns and say that we're going to take the bus. This is quite common in China, when people want to make a sale then they will try very hard to push you into buying their stuff. In the past I would have found this more pushy and unbearable, but if you were in a store competing with 100 other independent stores, or, you were a guy offering a tour to a place where the bus could take you for probably 1/5 of the price, you would push as well. This man was trying really hard to make a sale and actually it was a really admirable effort. The key, I think, is to really take no for an answer. The first time I said no I refused politely and he just kept trying to sell it to me. Of course, I could be more rude about it and flatly say, "No, I really don't want it." in a serious tone, but what would be the fun in that. Yes, I would get what I wanted but it would be totally rude. So, he keeps pushing. He says 30 is a great deal, it's the best deal. "Usually in the summer I take 7 or 8 people for a price way higher but now that it's winter the customers are scarce, so I'm giving you a good price." I don't believe him, the first quoted price is never the best, no matter who tells you. "I'll take you to site X, Y, and Z. The bus wont take you where, only I can, and I can explain to you what the sites are." OK - fair game, there are probably things that you could describe that the bus driver couldn't. "Plus, if there's anywhere else you want to go while up there it's included in the price." OK - fair as well, giving me the flexibility. But, I was still sold on the bus. It was 8 RMB for the both of us versus 30 his price.</p>
      <p>In the art of negotiation in China, the last thing that anyone will budge on is price. They will first gauge your interest to see if it's worth lowering the price and worth it to make a sale. As I looked more and more interested in going with him, I talked to Thorin in English to make it seem like we were considering. After a brief moment of chit chat, I said no, sorry, we'll just go on the bus. As we gesture for the bus driver to open the door - who, mind you, has probably noticed us trying to negotiate with him in his periphery - the guy says, "Alright, Alright, 20, final price then." That's how you know you've won a negotiation, when they're willing to cut their price by a certain amount. But, like I said, we're a bit stubborn with prices. We wanted the bus and we stuck to it. The guy must've known after lowering his price, and we didn't take it, that there was no more use convincing us. He was a smart salesman, and tried to make a great sale. But, even the best salesman knows when to quit. Proud buyers (us) are never people you push for sale. For a price of 8 RMB vs 20 RMB, a difference of 12 RMB and really, if split between 2 people, just 6 RMB (equivalent to 1 Singapore dollar, or 70 US Cents), if we really wanted a private car we would've tried harder to consider. But, like I said, we're proud buyers. We don't like to give into negotiation unless we really want something. The bus driver sees that we are done negotiating and opens the doors, and we pay our 8 RMB. We see the guy continue trying to make a sale to the other people that are passing by and possibly getting on the same bus as us. A Shanghai family boards the bus, only identifiable because I overheard them talking to the driver. You can tell they aren't from the north. They have kids dressed up wrapped all the way up in clothes, moreso than I've seen any Dongbei kid wear, with scarves wrapped around many times around the kids' mouths and noses, only having their eyes revealed. They're like a yarn ball of fabric. They look like they're from the city, and also sound like it with their softer accent. But, like many people from the more southern parts, they have come to see snow and Chinese history.</p>
      <p>The drive up is stunning. Dandong, like I said earlier, borders North Korea, and most people will go to see that specifically. while the bus drives up, there is the Yalu river on our right, and across from that, it is North Korea. I've never been closer to a country that I can't go into. Apparently, there are some land crossings that are possible for foreigners, but not to those with American passports - they must either fly from Shenyang or Beijing to Pyongyang directly for immigration purposes. But, looking across the frozen river, I realize the arbitrariness of a border. The scenery is beautiful, with the sun hitting and reflecting off the river, and the vast mountains off in the distance on North Korean land. There is a wire fence lining the Chinese side to prevent and defectors or escapists, but it's a very small unsuspecting wall. There is a sign that you pass probably ever kilometer that says it's a "Militarized Zone", but other than that, that's it for the Chinese side. It's just scenery for miles. The sun is shining very brightly today, the same sun that provides light for both the Chinese and North Korean side.&nbsp;</p>

      </figure>
      <p>As we get closer to the Great Wall, you can see the wall snaking along the hill. There is a "snow world" mini theme park where you can either go toboganning or 10-pin bowling by sliding down a hill right before the stop, and we see some kids sliding down plastic paddles here. The bus finally drops us off at a T-intersection lined with a few shops, and a rock with the Chinese characters for "Tiger Mountain Great Wall" carved in a deep red. There is a lady selling some 餅 nearby, which is just the word for a flattish, savory pancake. Except this one she has rolled up some sausages in there. We snack away on it as we enter the side gate to the main Great Wall entrance. Tickets are 55 RMB for the off-season, quite a steep price for a tourist site, but it is the great wall, and we've made it all the way to Dandong just for it.</p>
      <p>Everyone says now to go to see the Great Wall in Beijing. I disagree. Maybe 10 years ago that was the place to go see it, but now I imagine most of the roads leading up to the site would be full of traffic. Likewise, when you get to the Wall itself, it would be full of people and vendors trying to make a sale, with a lot of pedestrian and tourist traffic. That's the fate of future UNESCO sites and, in general, popular tourist sites that have defined a city, or perhaps even a country. When you think of China and 'places to see', you think of the Great Wall, no doubt. The key thing to realize though is that the Great Wall wasn't built over one construction period, it was built over successive amounts of time and occupied a very random assortment of places in the country. There are miles of the Wall stretching to various parts of the northern parts in China. Some have been well restored, and some have been left to just crumble. If you read any of Peter Hessler's book, Country Driving, you will understand that before tourism really took off in China in the 2000s, the wall was just another structure. Peoples houses were built up around it, and it was literally a bunch of assembled rock built to defend out various invasions (poorly, mind you) from the northern 'aggressive tribes'. Modern Chinese citizens have utilized it just as another supporting wall, not as a wall of defense (unless you're talking about from harsh weather conditions in Inner Mongolia, etc.) And so, the wall is nothing but a structure of practicality, as were most things built in China. When you go to see a part of the Great Wall that is refurbished, we don't really witness history as it was, but rather, a version of history that we want to memorialize. "Look at why China is great, our ancestors built the Great Wall."</p>
      <p>The Tiger Mountain Great Wall is similar. The government put in a ton of money to rebuild it in 1992 to attract tourism and keep it refurbished. I think this is a good initiative on the government, since in the past for China most of the initiatives have been to destroy any cultural relics in exchange for economic improvement. Perhaps in another 100 years people will be seeing the remnants of these modern megacities and going to explore the as sites to see. But, an important thing for us to realize is this tradeoff between authenticity and conservatism. We hate to go to overly tourist sites, but it helps the local economy. We hate to see unauthentic structures, but a certain amount of refurbishment must go into it to preserve it for future generations. What is my point, then? I think Beijing is one place to go see the Great Wall, yes, but there are many others as well. As in, it's not&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;place to see it. We picked our spot based on convenience of location, since it was doable by a day trip from Shenyang to Dandong. Every portion of the Great Wall is slightly different, and you can see how the local environment affects the appearance of the wall. As we were there in the winter, the Great Wall had this wonderful thin layer of snow along the pathway and on the watchtowers that connected the parts of the Wall. Like looking at the frozen river traveling out of Shenyang, never had I been happier to visit the Great Wall in the winter. Something about the snow and the sunlight makes it truly a structure to marvel at. And so even tohugh we walk across and look at the version of history that the Chinese want us to know, we still can't help but marvel at this wonderful construction. It's still like you're walking across living history. Except, this time the wall isn't separating China against the 'wild northerners.' On 虎山長城, Tiger Mountain Great Wall, it's China on one side, and North Korea on the other. Again, I point to the fluidity and arbitrary nature of borders.</p>

      <p>The Wall is absolutely beautiful, and steep at this part of China. The steps are all about a foot-and-a-half in length and the stairs are built into the steeping slopes of the Tiger Mountain. But, there's only a few tourists in sight. Being in a more obscure part of China, and also the winter, there are very few people that are willing to come out to climb out to the top. While we walk an dtake pictures we're able to do so in a pseudo-authentic way, without anyone else on the periphery, and just two lone people walking along. It's about a 30 minute climb to the top. The higher we go, the better the view gets, with the sun perfectly illuminating the city below, and so we occasionally stop to catch our breath and take a few pitures.</p>

      <p>When we get to the top we can see that most of the river separating China and North Korea has frozen over, but the sun hits the ice and reflects off at a certain brightness, and it's lovely. We put on our sunglasses. Our breath is clearly visible in the cold air, and for a second almost seems to surround us as we pant from the climb. To get to the apex of the mountain, you have to go into one of the towers and then climb a few stairs up. The pathway up is very narrow and only one-person wide, so while Thorin's ass is in my face we take the final few steps up to get a view of the small town below. There's some noise at the top from a few people at the top, and when we get to the top we end up seeing an entire tour group who has traveled together up on the mountain to take a picture. There are about 25 to 30 of them clustered at the top platform, and they are holding a banner that displays where they are from (I can't read it; there are a lot of words that I don't understand). They look at us in a way that many people do, a bit confused as to why a 亞人, an Asian person, is hanging out with a 洋人, literally the word for "Sea person", but meaning generally someone that comes from overseas. There is one man taking the picture of the group, presumably who is also part of the group. They sheepishly ask me in English to take a picture and I respond in Chinese to their ease. I take a panorama of the group as the tour group proudly smiles of their accomplishment of climbing to the top. They are all smiling and not panting; they've been up there for a while and are happy to be together. All of them wearing a bright smile as I sweep the man's iPhone across in panorama mode. A man in the background moves his position throughout the picture to appear multiple times throughout the picture.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>After I take the picture the lady asks if we want a picture, and we say yes. The guy who gave me his iPhone to take a picture takes my camera and snaps a shot of Thorin and me at the top of the mountain, one of the very few pictures we have with each other.</p>

      <p>They smile and then slowly descent down the staircase leading out. We stay up there for another minute or two to appreciate the scenery. It's beautiful up here, the air is fresh and we were lucky to come on a day where there was little pollution. On one side of the wall is the small town that is at the base of the Great Wall, and the tiny, flat-roof houses are lined up perfectly along the mountain, stacked at an angle such that you're able to appreciate each one. Each one is also perfectly capturing what little sunlight there is in the winter. Some window panes from our perspective are perfectly reflecting the sunlight in our eyes. On the other side, there is a barren, low-rise mountain range on the North Korean side. There seem to be a few buildings here and there but it is also flat for miles. On both ends here, there isn't much that is being built. But, the scenery is beautiful today as we bask in the sun and just take a moment to really appreciate where we are. Then, we follow after the tour group.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Steep climbs up are followed by steep climbs down, right. So in fact, the more daunting part of the journey was actually trekking down the Great Wall on the other side. If you trip on one of the steps down, it's a long fall down with little railing to hold onto. The descent is essentially a 80 or so degree angle on the way down. We see the tour group who I took a picture of go down, and they take about 5 or 6 seconds at each step, ctaching their perception and breath at each step. It's a bit of a slow process, with a few picture taking opportunities along the way, but it's pretty fun. The Chinese, like I've said many times, love to chat and joke, and they do so among friends openly. And so, when they walk down sometimes they take 5 steps and laugh and joke, or chat for a bit, and then they take another 10 and then stop for a picture. It's great, since we're watching them from behind.&nbsp;</p>

      </figure>
      <p>At the tower nearer to the bottom on the other side, you can stand on the top platform. There are only a few footsteps in the freshly fallen snow since there hasn't been much foot traffic for the day yet. The tour group goes up there and then some start making snowballs and throwing them at each other. The other half are taking pictures with the cannons that are placed at the top of the tower. Apparently, at this end of the Wall there is another entrance, and so you are able to walk from here to the other end where we initially started.&nbsp;</p>
      <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center">

      <p>The Tower we are standing on together with the tour group actually houses a museum inside of it, but when we asked the guards they said it was closed for the winter. I suppose that's the only downside, that although there aren't many people, there also isn't much open. The guard tells us that we can follow the road and walk all the way back to the T-intersection where the bus initially dropped us off. We look around. There's not much people standing around, and the road looks a bit long, but it looks like a lovely walk.</p>
      <p>One of the most difficult things of climbing the wall in the winter is the temperature control. We're wearing thick jackets that are meant to keep us warm, but the cardio from climbing the stairs is enough to do that. If we were to walk along the road we wouldn't know how long it would take; likewise, we would probably get a bit colder walking along a flat platform. But, we would essentially get to circumnavigate the the mountain and loop around the long way as opposed to cutting through it via the Great Wall. We've made this mistake many times in the past, whereby when we want to go to a certain spot by a certain time, we decide to take a new route only to find out that we either get entirely lost or end up hiking for an additional 2 hours. So, this time we go the way that we know, letting our experience guide us a bit as opposed to our sense of adventure: we make the climb back across the Wall from the direction we came.&nbsp;</p>
      <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center">
        <div><img src="images/dandong_28.JPG">
        </div>
      </figure>
      <p>The climb back is just as difficult, if not moreso since the steps are much more tall. Some of them are about two, two-and-a-half feet tall and require you to lift up your entire body weight for a short second as you ascend. We unzip our jackets and take off our scarves because we're sticking to ourselves under the layer of sweat that has begun to form from deep under. We hear a bunch of changting and shouting from below us. When I take a look back on top of the tower which had freshly fallen snow earlier, I see the same tour group still on there, except this time they are gathered in a circle and playing a game. I'm not entirely sure what the game is, but what it consists of is trying to knock the opponent down while maybe hopping up and down on one leg. The small circle is chanting on the people within it, and they are rooting for their favorite person to win. Anytime someone falls down there is a collective, "OH!!!!!" or uproarous laughter carries through and echoes across the mountain. Their voices are heard within a small radius but dissipate in the vast empty space of China and North Korea. In that moment there is a certain happiness and innocence to the Chinese that I observe, only observable usually when you watch people play a game. If you ever want to find out about someone, watch how they play games.&nbsp;</p>

        <div><img src="images/dandong_29.JPG">
        </div>
      </figure>
      <p>We make the climb back up and then the descent back from which we came. At each step we still continue to take more pictures since it's just absolutely breathtaking, and there's so much to take in.&nbsp;</p>
      <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center">

      <p>Eventually we make it back down to the bus stop, and pop into two of the convenience stores down at the base there. They are a small convenience store, without much. The electricity isn't on, and there isn't any general heating. The store owners are wrapped up in jackets and greet us with a friendly smile. One has a baby with incredibly rosy cheeks, flushed from being indoors after spending a few minutes outside in the harsh Dongbei winter. Thorin gets a cake, and then we take the bus back. The same Shanghai family is on the bus back with us. This time, the Snow Theme Park is on our left. North Korea is on our left. And, we make it back to Dandong proper.</p>
      <p>At this point, we really only had a few hours of sunlight left to explore the city. There is one famous site in Dandong called the Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge, which is one of the few land crossings connectors between North Korea and China.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>As you walk closer to the Yalu River, you're able to see actually two bridges. One of them clearly functional: on the Chinese end, you see a small Chinese post that says 'CHINESE IMMIGRATION BUREAU' with a few heavily armed guard cars stationed right outside of it. You also see a few trucks and more industrial looking vehicles on the bridge, waiting to pass into Dandong. You don't see a lot of passenger cars. The other bridge, the older Friendship Bridge, is the one that was bombed by the Americans a long time ago (you're welcome, couresty of America because, America). This bridge is now turned into a tourist attraction, with an entry fee of about 30 RMB to actually et in and walk across the bridge. This will get you about 2/3s of the way to North Korea, and when you get to the end you're able to look onto North Korean land. There is a ferris wheel and a mini roller coaster off in the distance, but it doesn't look like they are functioning. Actually, there is an oddity to it, something about there being an abandoned amusement park for people to just look blankly at is strange, especially at this border. Being the cheapskates that we are we don't pay to walk across the bridge, as from this shore we're able to get a decent view of the border.&nbsp;</p>
      <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center">

      </figure>
      <p>It's just normal land, aside from the ferris wheel and roller coaster. Instead of the bridge, we stroll along the boardwalk and just peer occasionally into the Yalu River. It's a really lovely walk. There are also street vendors trying to make a sale with us here, selling to us North Korean money. I joke with them that we don't want to buy it, since we can't justify spending money for more money as a souvenir. They laugh and keep trying to push other trinkets onto us, but as I said earlier, you never try to make a sale with a proud buyer. Nor do you try to with cheapskates.</p>
      <p>The boardwalk is great, it stretches along the main road and you're able to see a lot of restaurants built on the riverfront. There are a few that are marked with a North Korean flag, indicating that it is in fact a North Korean restaurant serving North Korean food. Apparently, some of the North Koreans will come over and set up business in these restaurants, and while you eat the girls will sing in Korean and also do some slight dancing, kind of like a performance restaurant. We decide to skip out on this, but we do stumble upon this very interesting supermarket that was marked with a North Korean flag.</p>
      <p>When we walk inside, we see a very modern supermarket. In fact, we've never even see a supermarket in Singapore that looked that nice. It looks very artisinal and everything is placed nicely. There are a lot of international imports, with the country of origin's flag placed neatly next to the product that they are trying to sell. All the of the staff look like either a cross section between Chinese or Korean. Some people look more Chinese, some people look more Korean. I assume they're all from Dong Bei since they're quite tall and their skin is all pale. There's random stuff like things from Italy, the U.S., Korea, Japan, etc. It's truly an international market. There's no one else inside but us, and the people stocking the shelves don't look or pay any attention to us, we're just another two people passing by. As Dandong is very close to the river, there is a separate section that sells fresh seafood as well. The entire market is pristinely clean with a light wooding for the floor and shelves. It's brightly lit. It's all oddly out of place. As we walk around and take a look at the different products, it really feels more lie you're in a European market. You then see the banners in Korean, and Chinese, and remember where you are. It's about 14:30 right now, and the restaurant in there was not open at the time, so we just leave.</p>
      <p>Walking around more, we see the mix of Korean and Chinese signs lining the streets. We pop into a small mart that has North Korean imported beer and so we buy a bottle for later to try. It's a pretty big market with a mix of Chinese and Korean import products as well. That's pretty defining of Dandong, the fact that it's just a cross culture of Korean and Chinese culture. We see it from the signs, the different kinds of products, and also the way that people look.</p>
      <p>For dinner, to end the night, we decide to try Korean. We wonder if it'll be like kind of a pseudo fusiony type of food, but it turns out to be just Korean. When we walk into the restaurant, the old auntie in the back tells the people sitting at the table closest to us that there are customers. They look surprised, and seem disinterested in serving us, quite a different turn from the man earlier trying to make a sale for us on his car, as well as the street vendors along the side of the river. We are a bit surprised too, as we thought they were actually customers, but they were just the wait staff who were eating and smoking. There are also two other people that have passed out at the table next to us, and the restaurant is overall pretty empty and a bit cold inside. There's really no ambience to the place, but there's an honesty to it. Their primary purpose is to sell food, not to make your dining experience the best you can have. But I like that sometimes about Chinese service, sometimes they're the least interested in selling things to you, sometimes they're the most passionate. Sometimes things are so catered, sometimes they could not give a damn. But, it was 3:30 anyway. Right in between lunch and dinner. They have our patronage for the day as we had a train to catch soon. We order a cold noodle dish, a stonepot rice dish, and another style of 涼拌, which is essentially just cold noodles stirred together in a sauce. Very good food. Different styles of flavors that we are used to. When we get up to leave the staff help us open the door on the way out and thank us for coming. A bit of that Chinese service shining through.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Although it seems like we didn't do much, another day had passed. We see the Mao statue again at the station, and we see the big sign of 'DAN DONG' on top of the station. The only thing different is that this time the sun was setting. The train ride back is a reversal of the way in. The buildings of Dandong. The barren agricultural plots of Shenyang. And then, before we arrive back to Shenyang, darkness. There are some lights from the local housing collectives we pass along the way, and lights strung around the recently developed highways in the region. It's not until we reach the city that the lights of the massive cosmopolitan city of Shenyang, the economic capital of the Dongbei region, interrupts the darkness.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Border cities are some of my favorite. They really are at a crossroads of culture. When you ask the Chinese about their ethnic groups, they will list Korean as one of them. "But," they say, "they are Chinese. We are all Chinese! But they are Korean.. " It's a bit difficult for them to explain in English, but I think it's regarding the concept of how nationality of being Chinese trumps any kind of self identity as a minority. Yes, the Koreans here look Korean and some of them indeed do speak Korean, but for sure they all speak Chinese. This is the most important. In fact, many of them will still identify as Chinese with just a Korean background. However, they're still considered an ethnic group and are openly able to practice their subculture (of which we would discover in Shenyang's 西塔, Xita region). I love border cities for that reason, because they purposely blend what arbitrary borders that politics or history has drawn. It's the next frontier of multiculturalism and globalism.</p>
