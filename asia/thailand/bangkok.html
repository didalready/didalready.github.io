      <h2>BANGKOK, THAILAND</h2>
      <h4>2015-11-20, 20:16, JASON</h4>
      <h4>STAY: A FRIEND'S PLACe</h4>
      <p>‍</p>
      <p>We arrived into Ekkamai around 5 p.m. in the afternoon. Most of the temples had closed so we decided to just have a night out instead. Neha and Rahil's friend was kind enough to let us stay at his apartment in Bangkok, in Soi 16. Pretty central, so there was easy access to bars and what not. We go to Suk 11 for some posh Thai food, probably the best Thai food I had. But, I got to be real. That meal we had at a bus station (Mo Chit) on our way to Pattaya was ballin' as F and half the price. Eh, you're on vacation, you shell out.</p>
      <p>We get some drinks at some expatted out joint in Soi 11. They had Syder Bay on offer. Tasted like Martinellis yo. Reminds me of college and Smirnoff Ice. After, we took a tuktuk onto Soi 4, and walked around Soi 2 to the main gay area. We went quite early and it was not as popping. So, we took a seat down and just drank happy hour on offer. It was alright. It's not so much that gay people&nbsp;<em>like</em>&nbsp;hanging out with each other all the time, I'm convinced we just know how to find a strong drink at cheap price.</p>
      <p>I have to elaborate on the tuktuk experience a bit. It's quintisentially Thai-tourist transport, and I love it. Allow me to digress. Before I white girl out on you and praise how exotic the experience riding a tuk tuk was, how I ate, prayed, and loved my way through Bangkok, and probably rolled out a yoga mat wearing bebe, I have to say: I get it. Bangkok is very dynamic. There's lots going on. There's food for cheap, drink for cheap, and it's fucking good food. You can pull up on a side street, find a small pushcart, and they are selling legitimate noodles, papaya salad, yes, Thai Iced Tea. The Thai are generally friendly and willing to help. There's an edginess to them. I wouldn't call it exotic at the risk of mysticizing them, but it's foreign to me, and I love it. They're different in their own way, much as an American is to a mainland Chinese I imagine, and that's refreshing. In the short time we were there, I thought the city was so fresh, current. I can see why a lot of tourists like to go. Back to the main point here, the tuktuk ride. The tuktuk ride captures in essence the city of Bangkok. You really feel you're in southeast Asia when you're riding open air on the motorway, 4 friends packed into the back. I took a moment to just look out and felt HASHTAG BLE3SS3D. there's something about riding open-air on the freeway that is oddly naked but positively liberating. Maybe that's what Bangkok is to me.. just liberating.</p>

      <p>The next day was our main sightseeing day. We wanted to hit up some temples, and go to a floating market. We first stopped off at a Golden Buddha temple. Architecture spot on.</p>

      <p>After the Golden Buddha, we kept walking. We didn't realize how far it was a walk from the BTS station, but that's ok. We got to pass by Chinatown, which was probably the most sprawling one I've seen. Every single small alley on the street had something going on; some food or stuff. It was packed. There were a lot of jewelry stores. It was absolutely bustling, so exciting.</p>

      <p>After walking about 1 hour, we arrive to Wat Pho. Since we didn't realize it'd take so long, we did a quickish tour of it. There was a huge reclining Buddha just chilling, but its feet were under construction (there are inscriptions on it). Damn, Buddha, you totally let us down. We take a walk around the grounds and are fascinated by the tiled architecture.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>After Wat Pho, we walk again, what seems like miles to another temple. Initially, we want to go to see a Black Buddha that some construction man told us to go to, but we never make it there since we want to head to a floating market (Amphawa). So, we end up stopping by a really cool temple, a bit of a hike up. Not sure what it was called, but it was very scenic at the top. The temple was full of students, probably in high school, drawing cityscapes of Bangkok from the top of the temple. I'm not sure if it was an art school, but those kids drew legit pictures.. and they were so young. Am I at that age when I realize I'm older and not as talented as today's youth?</p>

      <p>So, our goal was to head to Amphawa. Take a 3 o'clock bus, get there by 5:30, walk around, and then take the last bus back. But, turns out the timing of the bus was later, and we would have only had one hour for sightseeing. We abandoned the plan and decided to go to Chatuchak Market, just at the Mo Chit stop. The place was amazing. Bustling stalls, and really nice cheap food ducked into the back of places. Got a Papaya Salad somewhere.. OF COURSE. No pictures from that. There are some videos though, you can sift through them. See the top for the hyperlink.</p>
      <p>The next day, we decide to go to the Grand Palace. The most popular place in Bangkok. Our last day, why not. We get there on a boat ferry, which is similar to the tuk tuk ride. The place was cool, but there wasn't much open for the price we paid to get in. 500 Baht (20 SGD, roughly 14 USDish) for one entry? There wasn't even that much open. You know how many papaya salads you can get for that? Anyway - probably didn't help that it was raining the whole time, but I guess it's one of the places you pay for. That's all we had time for on the last day just because it took forever to get in and out -- security, etc. But, again, the architecture is stunningly unique and takes your breath away. The Thais really knew how to do their buildings.</p>
