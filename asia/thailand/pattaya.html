      <h2>PATTAYA, THAILAND</h2>
      <h4>2015-11-19, 17:03, JASON</h4>
      <h4>STAY: EASTINY SEVEN HOTEL</h4>
      <p>‍</p>
      <p>We got in to Pattaya at about 19:00 via bus from Don Mueang airport. As that is night time, the city was alright popping a bit. We walked from the bus station, adequately called the "Air Conditioned Bus Station" on Google Maps. A functional name.</p>
      <p>Guys, Pattaya on Soi 8 and Beach Road is nuts. Thorin and I are walking down with our backpacks, in our short shorts, and prostitutes begin soliciting us asking us to take them to our hotel. At one point, this one links arms with me and asks me if I want to go home with them; I politely decline. But, these girls are STRONG. They latch on and refuse to let go, and they swarm. At one point (sorry mom, and friends and family that you have to read this) they even grab your cock and try to pull you over. It's scarring, but an experience.</p>
      <p>Onto the city. The entire *main* strip is dedicated to old-aged, chubbier white men to date young, Thai girls. There wasn't a single person, that we noticed, under 30 years old in the bars. Most of them were Russian, and some of the signs were in the Cyrillic alphabet. There is a dinky little beach that is industrial, and also a few little restaurants here and there. Overall, not much to do, but culturally (if we can ascribe this word to that) a highlight of exploitation of sex-workers in the developing world. Although, this is probably a very small reflection of Pattaya. I'm sure the city itself is suburban otherwise, without the overrun tourist portions.</p>
      <p>Our main reason for venturing here was to meet up with our good friends, Neha and Rahil. We just drank and caught up on the beach, which was actually relaxing away from the main strip. There are these pickup trucks that are essentially bigger tuktuks that take you around the city -- supposedly to the strip club. We took one of thse back to the bus station, since they gave us a super discount. But, as quickly as we got in, we got out immediately after. One foot in, two feet out. Onto Bangkok then.</p>
      <p>Oh, yeah, and it was Thorin's and my first experience eating bugs! There was a vendor selling various assorted insects, and we thought to try the mealworms. They were a bit pricy, but we think that's because it was off the main strip. What does it taste like? Cheezits. But, they get trite after a while and lose flavor. If anything, it tasted more like seasoning since it was so oversalted. Didn't get a chance to try anymore.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Took a bus from the 'air conditioned bus station' directly to Ekkamai station. Quiet bus ride for the most part. Love a good quiet bus ride.</p>
