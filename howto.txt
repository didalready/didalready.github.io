1) Pushing to web

Change to the registry ../DidAlready

git status , checks which updates there are
git add . , adds all the changes
git commit -m "test" , commits the changes
git push , pushes it to github.io ##This should work post-no-password phase (password: happybuu03#)

2) Image storage / depository
#In GDrive Wipe 2022, pictures were not linked. Change to hosted locally

	A) FOR IMAGES IN POST
	 i) Within each country folder, create "images" folder
	 ii) nomenclature for images: nameOfPost_n, where nameOfPost=html file name; n=nth picture in post
	
	B) FOR THUMBNAILS (post thumbnail):
	 i) keep in "images" folder in the main directory. do not store in individual post (changing references too troublesome)
