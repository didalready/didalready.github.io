      <h2>AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS</h2>
      <h4>2016-01-18, 22:04, JASON</h4>
      <h4>STAY: EASYHOTEL AMSTERDAM</h4>
      <p>‍</p>
      <p>We were getting good at finding ways into countries. Being in the EU definitely helped since we were in Schengen. For this trip, we decided to take a COACH into Amsterdam. That's right, MegaBus had a deal on offer. They were charging 25 pounds to get into Amsterdam. The grueling task? Spend 12 hours in a coach. The other one? Staying at easyHotel. Remember from the&nbsp;Budapest&nbsp;trip that we had some easyHotel credits leftover from when we first moved to London. This trip was inspired in part of utilizing those credits. We really go full circle here. Anyway, yeah, easyHotel, and a coach.</p>
      <p>But, surprising, this wasn't too much of an issue. The first half of this trip was driving down to Dover and then taking a ferry across into Paris. The ferry ride itself was a bit rough, just a couple of chavs chilling out drinking ciders (we were one of them..), but, hey, for the cheap tickets it was worth it, and an experience. As a result, we didn't get an Amsterdam stamp, we got a French one. The latter half of the trip was driving from France into Amsterdam. We arrived at the fresh time of 7 in the morning, 12 hours after we'd left the night before. Moral? Always check your options for getting into countries. The only thing you have to put up with are groggy looking people at 7. They're not pretty, but neither are you. There was an American girl next to me, and when we got into Rotterdam, she opened her crust-ladened eyes and said , "ommgggggggg where arreeeeee weee??? it's byoouuuuuuutifull!!!" then went back to sleep. We hadn't even gotten to Amsterdam; it was Rotterdam, and some industrial park of it. Girl..</p>

      <p>Getting in early lent itself to a crisp morning. Since it was still early, we were able to walk around from the bus station into central Amsterdam. We found a local coffeeshop and sat in there. Amsterdam is a fresh city: everything is centered around the canals, everyone is deadly liberal, and everyone is just laid back and nice. One of the few cities that we thought we could live in for a while. It really lends itself to convenience, and just about bleedin' everyone is riding around on bikes. We saw moms with a wagon-pullalong attached to her bike with 3 kids chilling around in it. No wonder they're so tall, must be all that fresh air and biking.</p>
      <p>In terms of sites, we just walked around the canals and photographed some main buildings. One reason we stopped over in Amsterdam was to visit our friend Marcus and a friend of his. He grew up in Rotterdam (I think, I don't even remember anymore dude). Really, other than that, I think we went into a gay bar, and did general exploration. It was nice not having to have plans. Wandering around the city is nice since each ring has its own small personality to it. Architecturally, since the city is quite centralized everything is packed closely and very Dutch-looking. If anything, it's one of the more stand-out cities architecturally. They have their staggering churches and buildings, but the houses (and especially windows) are designed in a way as to evoke Nordic simplicity, but French design.</p>
      <p>Marcus's friend took us to the Red Light District at night. I felt strange in there. They kind of cuck at you expecting to go in, but, alas, that ship sailed for me a long time ago. Sorry ladies, I'll appreciate you from afar.</p>
      <p>From Amsterdam, we walked our asses back to the main station and took a train down into&nbsp;Brussels. You have to love Europe, and all its convenience and cost in traveling. And, no, we never did ingest marijuana. Maybe then, we would've enjoyed it more...&nbsp;</p>
